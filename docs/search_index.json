Chapter 1 describes the steps for defining the scope of a reproduction exercise. Use Survey 1 to record your work for this stage. In this stage, you are not expected to review the reproduction materials in detail, and most of the exercise’s time should be dedicated to the later stages. You are expected to spend between 1-3 days in the Scoping stage. 1.1 Select a candidate paper or be assigned one. Ideally, you should select your candidate paper without previously exploring the availability of materials. In the following sections (1.2 and 1.3) these guidelines will show you how to inspect the feasibility of starting a reproduction exercise in your candidate paper. If there are not enough materials to pursue a reproduction, you will be asked to create a short entry in the ACRE platform (&lt;15 minutes) and select a new candidate paper. Repeat this step until you have found a paper with a reproduction package, this will be your declared paper. Do not invest time in doing a detailed read of any paper until you are sure to have declared paper. 1.2 Check records on the ACRE platform. Check the ACRE database for previous assessments of the your candidate paper. If there are previous entries, you will see a brief report card with the following information: Title: Sample Title Authors: Jane Doe &amp; John Doe Original Reproduction Package Available: URL/No [If “No”] Contacted Authors?: Yes/No [If “Yes(contacted)”] Type of Response: Categories (6). Additional Reproduction Packages: Number (eg., 2) Authors Available for Further Questions for ACRE Reproductions: Yes/No/Unknown Open for reproductions: Yes/No 1.3 Verify that reproduction package exist. Verify that the paper has a reproduction package. If there is no reproduction package, use our records to check if requests to authors a reproduction package have been made before. If nobody has yet submitted a similar request, you are encouraged to contact the authors using language suggested here, making sure to copy (acre@berkeley.edu). We will define a reproduction package as the collection of all the materials associated with the reproduction of a paper. A reproduction package may contain data, code, and documentation. When the materials are provided in the original publication they will be labeled as ‘original reproduction package’, when they provided by a previous reproducer they will be referred to as ‘reproducer X’s reproduction package’. At this point you are only assessing the existence of one (or more) reproduction packages, you are will not be assessing the quality of its content at this stage. If the authors provide any materials, create a public project in the [Open Science Framework/ICPSRopen/Dataverse] and deposit all these materials under the name Original reproduction materials for - Title of the paper. Provide the URL for the repository in the ACRE records. If the authors have been contacted before and provided no response, you are encouraged to follow up with a reminder email using the same language. Do not forget to copy (acre@berkeley.edu). If the authors have provided a response but the reproduction package is still missing, you should verify the category assigned to the original response. If the author indicated that they cannot provide any additional information you are discourage from contacting them again. Create a record in the ACRE database. If you verified the existence of a reproduction package, your candidate paper is now your declared paper for the ACRE exercise. You can now read the paper! If you verified the reproduction package does not exist, please leave the proper record in our ACRE database and select a new candidate paper. View Decision Tree To Select Paper 1.4 Read and summarize the paper. Depending on how much time you have, we recommend that you write a short summary of the paper. This will help remind you of the key elements to focus on for the reproduction, and to demonstrate your understanding of the paper (for yourself and potentially for the original author). When reading/summarizing the paper, you should try to answer the following main questions: Would you classify the paper’s scientific claims as mainly focused on estimating a causal relationship, estimating/predicting a descriptive statistic of a population, or something else? How many scientific claims (descriptive or causal) are investigated in the paper? What is the population for which the estimates apply? What is the main population that is the focus of the paper as a whole? What are the main data sources used in the paper? How many outputs are in the paper (tables, figures and inline results)? What is the main statistical or econometric method used to examine each claim? What is the author’s preferred specification (or yours if authors are not clear)? What are some robustness checks to the preferred specification? 1.5 Declare scope of the exercise. By now you should have selected a paper that contains a reproduction package, and have a fairly good understanding of the content of the paper. You need not, however, have spend any time reviewing the reproduction package in detail. At this point, you should clearly specify which part of the paper you will attempt to reproduce. The reproduction excercise, as presented in these guidelines, is less focused on the whole paper and more focused on specific estimates, represented by a unique combination of claim-output-specification. If you are planning on assessing more than one claim or output, we strongly advise to start with one and record your results. Then you can initiate another record in ACRE for the second (or third) component to reproduce, and use the materials and knowledge you develop in the first exercise. Declare specific estimates to reproduce. The reproduction excercise will be estimate-especific. For this you will be asked to identify one of the scientific claims, and their corresponding preferred specification. If the authors did not explicitly choose a particular estimate, you will be ask to select one. In addition to the preferred estimate you will be asked to reproduce up to five estimates that correspond to alternative specifications of the preferred estimate. Declare possible robustness checks (optional). After reading the paper you might have wonder why the authors did not conduct a specific robustness test. If you think that such analysis could have been done within the same methodology, and using the same data (eg., including/excluding a subset of the data like “high-school dropouts” o “women”), please specify a robustness test that you would like to test before starting the assessment stage. This concludes all the elements that you will need to conduct the scoping stage. You now have all the elements necesary to complete Survey 1. Bonus: Identify your relevant timeline. Before you begin working on the three main stages of the reproduction exercise (assessment, improvement, and robustness), it is important to manage expectations (yours and those of your Instructor/Advisor). Be mindful of your time limitations when defining the scope of your reproduction activity. This will be given by the type of exercise chosen by the instructor/academic advisory. These will vary from a short format of a homework over a couple of weeks, to a medium format corresponding to a longer class project that that may take a month to complete, long format of a semester-long project (for example as an undergraduate thesis). Table 1 shows tentative distribution of time across three different reproduction formats. The scoping and assessment stages are expected to last roughly the same across all formats (with some additional day for the semester long format, foreseeing less experience with research if the reproducer is an undergraduate). Difference emerge in distribution the time for the last two main stages: Improvements and Robustness. For exercises of short duration, we recommend to stay away from any possible improvements to the raw data (or cleaning code), this will intern limit the amount of robustness check (for example by not being able to reconstruct variable according to slightly different definitions), but it should leave plenty of space for testing different specifications at the analysis level. .tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;} .tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;} .tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;} .tg .tg-baqh{text-align:center;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-c3ow{border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-dvpl{border-color:inherit;text-align:right;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-0lax{text-align:left;vertical-align:top} 2 weeks (~10 days) 1 month (~20 days) 1 semester (~100 days) analysis data raw data analysis data raw data analysis data raw data Scoping 10% (1 day) 5% (1 day) 3% (3 days) Assessment 25% 15% 7% Improvement 20% 0% 40% 20% 30% Robustness 30% 10% 30% 30% Extension 5% 0% 10% 10% Paper on PBR.
