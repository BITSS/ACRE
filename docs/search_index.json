You will verify whether or not a reproduction package for your candidate paper exists. If your candidate paper has a reproduction package, only then it will become your declared paper. If your candidate paper does not have a reproduction package you will be asked to leave a brief record in the ACRE database (under current development), and choose another candidate paper. Optionally, you are also suggested to contact the authors with a specific request for materials to create a public reproduction package. In this stage, you are not expected to review the reproduction materials in detail, as you will dedicate most of your time to this in later stages of the exercise. If materials are available, you will read the paper and declare the scope of the reproduction exercise. You can expect to spend between 1-3 days in the Scoping stage. Use Survey 1 to record your work for this stage. 1.1 Select a candidate paper or be assigned one. Ideally you will select your candidate paper without having previously explored the availability of its materials. In the following sections (1.2 and 1.3), these guidelines will show you how to inspect the feasibility of starting a reproduction exercise for your candidate paper. If there are not enough materials to pursue a reproduction, you will be asked to create a short entry in the ACRE platform (no more than 15 minutes) and select a new candidate paper. Repeat this step until you have found a paper with a reproduction package – this will be your declared paper and you will try to reproduce it for the remainder of the ACRE exercise. Do not invest time in doing a detailed read of any paper until you are sure that it is your declared paper. 1.2 Check records on the ACRE platform. Check the ACRE database (under development) for previous assessments of your candidate paper. If there are previous entries, you will see a brief report card with the following information: Title: Sample Title Authors: Jane Doe &amp; John Doe Original Reproduction Package Available: URL/No [If “No”] Contacted Authors?: Yes/No [If “Yes(contacted)”] Type of Response: Categories (6). Additional Reproduction Packages: Number (eg., 2) Authors Available for Further Questions for ACRE Reproductions: Yes/No/Unknown Open for reproductions: Yes/No 1.3 Verify that a reproduction package exists We define a reproduction package (sometimes referred to as a “replication package”) as the collection of all materials that make it possible for a reproducer to reproduce the paper. This package may contain data, code, and/or documentation. At this point you are only validating the existence of one (or more) reproduction packages and not assessing the quality of its content. When the materials are provided in the original publication, they will be labeled as “the original reproduction package”. If they are later created by a reproducer, they will be referred to as “reproducer X’ reproduction package”. Verify that the paper has a reproduction package that contains at least some materials. If there is no reproduction package, use our records to check if requests to authors have been made before requesting materials from original authors. If no one has submitted a similar request, you can contact the authors using language suggested here. Alternatively, you can simply choose a different paper and record the candidate paper at the beginning of Survey 1. Contacting the original authors to request a reproduction package. We strongly encourage you to contact authors several weeks before officially starting the Scoping stage of this exercise. Instructors should also plan to use the ACRE exercise accordingly. Before contacting the authors, we recommend that you review and use language from Chapter 6: Communications guidance below. If the authors provide any materials, deposit them in a trusted repository (for example Open Science Framework, Open ICPSR, or Dataverse) and deposit all these materials under the name Original reproduction package for - Title of the paper. Provide the URL of the repository in Survey 1. If you fail to obtain the reproduction package and would like to choose a different paper, please record this in the “abandoned reproduction” section of Survey 1. Now that you have verified the existence of a reproduction package, your candidate paper is now your declared paper. You can now move forward with the exercise! View Decision Tree To Select Paper 1.4 Read and summarize the paper. Depending on how much time you have, we recommend that you write a short summary of the paper. This will help remind you of the key elements to focus on for the reproduction, and to demonstrate your understanding of the paper (for yourself and others like your instructor/advisor). When reading/summarizing the paper, you should try to answer the following main questions: Would you classify the paper’s scientific claims as mainly focused on estimating a causal relationship, estimating/predicting a descriptive statistic of a population, or something else? How many scientific claims (descriptive or causal) are investigated in the paper? What is the population for which the estimates apply? What is the main population that is the focus of the paper as a whole? What are the main data sources used in the paper? How many outputs are in the paper (tables, figures and inline results)? What is the main statistical or econometric method used to examine each claim? What is the author’s preferred specification (or yours if authors are not clear)? What are some robustness checks to the preferred specification? 1.5 Declare scope of the exercise. By now you should have selected a paper that contains a reproduction package, and have a fairly good understanding of the content of the paper. You do not, however, need to have spent any time reviewing the reproduction package in detail. At this point, you should clearly specify which part of the paper will be the main focus of your reproduction excercise1. You are asked to focus on specific estimates, represented by a unique combination of claim-output-specification, that represent the authors’ preferred specification for a given claim (or yours). If you plan to scope more than one claim, we strongly recommend starting with one and recording your results. You can initiate another record in ACRE later for the second (or third, etc.) claim to reproduce, using the materials and knowledge you developed in the first exercise. Declare specific main estimates to reproduce. Identify one of the scientific claims, and its corresponding preferred specification, and record its magnitude, standard error, and location in the paper (page, table #, and row and column in the table). If the authors did not explicitly choose a particular estimate, you will be asked to select one. In addition to the preferred estimate, you will be asked to reproduce up to five estimates that correspond to alternative specifications of the preferred estimate. Declare possible robustness checks to main estimates (optional). After reading the paper, you might wonder why the authors did not conduct a specific robustness test. If you think that such analysis could have been done within the same methodology, and using the same data (eg., including/excluding a subset of the data like “high-school dropouts” or “women”), please specify a robustness test that you would like to test before starting the assessment stage. These are the elements you will need to conduct the scoping stage. You now have all the elements necesary to complete Survey 1. Bonus: Identify your relevant timeline. Before you begin working on the three main stages of the reproduction exercise (assessment, improvement, and robustness), it is important to manage expectations (yours and those of your instructor/advisor). Be mindful of your time limitations when defining the scope of your reproduction activity. These will depend on the type of exercise chosen by your instructor/advisor, and may vary from a homework assignment (e.g., over a couple of weeks), to a longer class project that that may take a month to complete or a semester-long project (for example as an undergraduate thesis). Table 1 shows a tentative distribution of time across three different reproduction formats. The scoping and assessment stages are expected to last roughly the same amount of time across all formats (lasting longer for the semester-long activities, expecting less experience with research if the reproducer is an undergraduate student). Differences emerge in the distribution of time for the last two main stages: Improvements and Robustness. For shorter exercises, we recommend staying away from any possible improvements to the raw data (or cleaning code). This will limit how many robustness checks are possible (for example, by limiting your ability to reconstruct variables according to slightly different definitions), but it should leave plenty of time for testing different specifications at the analysis level. .tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;} .tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;} .tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;} .tg .tg-baqh{text-align:center;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-c3ow{border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-dvpl{border-color:inherit;text-align:right;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-0lax{text-align:left;vertical-align:top} 2 weeks (~10 days) 1 month (~20 days) 1 semester (~100 days) analysis data raw data analysis data raw data analysis data raw data Scoping 10% (1 day) 5% (1 day) 3% (3 days) Assessment 25% 15% 7% Improvement 20% 0% 40% 20% 30% Robustness 30% 10% 30% 30% Extension 5% 0% 10% 10% Paper on PBR.
