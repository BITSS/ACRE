Potential benefits of following the Clarebout Principle

Well discussed potential positive effects on:
- Pedagogy  
- Incremental generation of knowledge 
]
--

.font130[
Under discussed:

- Possible positive effect on diversity, equity and inclusion: no connections or language skills ("appropriate politeness") required to obtain materials 
]

???
An under discussed benefit of this principle is that increases access to knowledge for students who are outside of elite schools (no connections or "appropriate politeness" required to obtain materials).

.font120[
- In each of the previous steps there was valuable new knowledge 
- This knowledge is not usually disseminated  
  - End of semester report, or presentation that is not published. 
  - Language across courses is not standard (reproduction? replication?)
  - Current attempts to record this are closer to a full paper format (see [Replication Wiki](https://replication.uni-goettingen.de/))
- As a result there is a large amount of missed knowledge.  
   - Each new semester, new students repeat similar excesses and have to reinvent the wheel.  
   - Lost opportunity for building on top of previous exercises. 
   - Lost opportunity for aggregating the new knowledge.

# Context for ACRE

- American Economics Association (AEA) creates first data policy in 2006.  

    - Must publish some data (waivers available)
--

- AEA updates [policy in 2019](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-code/). 
    - Must post all data and code. Publication is conditional on verifying reproducibility (if confidential: must document extensively) 
    - A new requirement is to post all cleaning code, even for data that is not public
    - See Lars Vilhuber's presentation after this one (same zoom channel) for more information 
--
x
- We should expect high levels of computational reproducibility after 2019 (AEA). 
--

- We should not demand 100% reproducibility before, but we could identify the gaps and try to improve some.

# Beyond Binary Judgments    

Reproductions can easily gravitate towards adversarial exchanges.
  - Early career researcher (ECR) have incentives to emphasize unsuccessful reproductions 
  - Original authors have a more senior position and can use it to deter in-depth reproductions from ECRs. 
  - The media also focuses on eye-catching headlines

--


### Our approach: 

We do not want to say 
 &gt; "Paper X is (ir)reproducible"    
 
  
--
We do want to say 
 &gt; "Paper X's result Y has a high/low level of reproducibility according to several reproduction attempts. Moreover, improvements have been made to the original reproduction package, increasing its reproducibility to a higher level"

Each **reproduction attempt** &lt;/br&gt;
is center around scientific &lt;/br&gt;
**claims**

One paper can contain  
several claims. 

Each claim may be &lt;/br&gt;
supported by various &lt;/br&gt;
**display items** (tables, &lt;/br&gt; 
figures &amp; inline)

A reproduction attempt is &lt;/br&gt;
at the claim level, and  &lt;/br&gt; 
reproducers must record  &lt;/br&gt;
their **specifications** of &lt;/br&gt;

# .font70[Identify All the Elements Behind a Display Item]

Reproducers will be asked to draw a clear connection to from the raw data sources mentioned in the paper and the display item under reproduction. 
--

### Data sources  
Connect the data sources in the paper's text with specific raw data files. 
--

### Analytic data sets  
Describe each analytic data file. 
--

### Code files  
Inspect all code files and record all their inputs and outputs. 

With all the information recorded above, reproducers can use the *ACRE Diagram Builder* to generate a **reproduction tree**.

# Improvements 

&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

## Three types of improvements: 

.font130[

1. Improvements at the paper level 
2. Improvements at the display-item level  
3. Specific future improvements

# Improvements: Paper-level

.font140[
- Use version control software (Git/Github).
- Improve documentation: comments, indentations, object names, etc.   
- Re-organize the reproduction package into a set of folders and sub-folders that follow [standardized best practices](https://www.projecttier.org/tier-protocol/specifications/#overview-of-the-documentation), and add a master script that executes all the code in order, with no further modifications. [See AEA's reproduction template](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template).  
- Literate programming environment (e.g., Jupyter notebooks, RMarkdown)
- Re-write code using a differenet statistical software (ideally open source, like R, Python, or Julia).
- Set up a computing capsule (e.g., [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) and [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/)).

# Improvements: Display item-level 
&lt;/br&gt;

.font120[
- Adding missing raw data: files or meta-data  
  - Example: "Add raw temperature and relative humidity data"
- Adding missing analytic data files
  - Example: "Copy the row files from Data folder into new `Analysis\trade cost\Input`"
- Adding missing analysis or cleaning code
  - Example: "Replaced broken Wald bootstrap code with updated code/command"
- Debugging code  
  - Example:  "was counting each group 4 times in round 1, so fixed that"

# Improvements: future possible 

We ask reproducer to leave concise and actionable tasks for other reproducers in the future. 

Example 1: 
&gt;"Revise the .aml and .bat code scripts to reflect reorganized structure"


Example 2: 
&gt; "Provide data and codes generating the other two figures in the paper, which are not given in the replication file."


Example 3: 
&gt; "Table 3 can be reproduced identically from the [...] analytic data files. I was not able to reproduce the analytic data files due to lack of access to ArcGIS software, but the code scripts and raw data files [...] are included in the reproduction package."

# Robustness Checks 

&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

## Two main parts for robustness: 

.font130[
1. Increase the number of robustness checks
2. Justify the appropriateness of a specific test

**Reasonable specifications** ([Simonsohn et. al., 2018](https://urisohn.com/sohn_files/wp/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Paper-Specification-curve-2018-11-02.pdf)): 

 1. Sensible tests of the research question
 2. Expected to be statistically valid, and 
 3. Not redundant with other specifications in the set.

Reproducers will be able to record two types of contributions: 

- Mapping the universe of robustness checks
- Proposing a specific robustness check

# Promoting a Constructive Exchange 

#### 1 - Contacting the original author(s) when there is no reproduction package
#### 2 - Contacting the original author(s) to request specific missing items of a reproduction package
#### 3 - Asking for additional guidance when some materials have been shared  
#### 4 - Response when the original author has refused to share due to *undisclosed reasons*   
#### 5 - Response when the original author has refused to share due to legal or ethical restrictions of the data
#### 6 - Contacting the original author to share the results of your reproduction exercise
#### 7 - Responding to hostile responses from original authors

#### Under development: sample responses form authors to reproducers

&gt;**Subject:** Reproduction package for `[“Title of the paper”]`

&gt;Dear Dr. `[Lastname of Corresponding Author]`,
&gt;
&gt; I am contacting you to request a reproduction package for your paper titled `[Title]` which was published in `[Reference]`. A reproduction package may contain (raw and/or analytic) data, code, and other documentation that makes it possible to reproduce paper. Would you be able to share any of these items?
&gt;
&gt;I am a `[position]` at `[Institution]`, and I would like to reproduce the results, tables, and other figures using the reproduction materials mentioned above. I have chosen this paper because `[add context ...]`. Unfortunately, I was not able to locate any of these materials on the journal website, Dataverse `[or other data and code repositories]`, or in your website.
&gt;
&gt;I will record the result of my reproduction attempt on ACRE [...]. With your permission, I will also record the materials you share with me, which would allow access for other reproducers and avoid repeated requests directed to you. Please let me know if there are any legal or ethical restrictions that apply to all or parts of the reproduction materials so that I can take that into consideration during this exercise.
&gt;
&gt;In addition to your response above, would you be available to respond to future (non-repetitive) inquiries from me or other reproducers conducting an ACRE excercise? Though your cooperation with my and/or any future request would be extremely helpful, please note that you are *not required to comply*.

&gt;Since I am required to complete this project by `[date]`, I would appreciate your response by `[deadline]`.
&gt;
&gt;Let me know if you have any questions. Please also feel free to contact my supervisor/instructor `[Name (email)]` for further details on this exercise. Thank you in advance for your help!
&gt;
&gt;Best regards,

# An example of well described issues:

.font80[
&gt;Specifically, I am attempting to reproduce OUTPUT X (e.g., table 1, figure 3). I found that the following components are required to reproduce to reproduce OUTPUT X:     

```md

            └───[code] formatting_table1.R
                ├───output1_part1.txt

                |          └───[code] data_cleaning01.R*

                              └───[data] admin_01raw.csv* 
```

&gt;I have marked with an asterix (\*) the items that I could not find in the reproduction materials: data_cleaning01.R and admin_01raw.csv. After accessing these files, I will also be able to identify the name of the raw data set required to obtain output1_part1.txt. This is to let you know that I may need to contact you again if I cannot find this file (labeled as UNKNOWN above) in the reproduction materials.
&gt;
&gt;I understand that this request will require some work for you or somebody in your research group, but I want to assure you that I will add these missing files to the reproduction package for your paper on the ACRE platform. Doing this will ensure that you will not be asked twice for the same missing file.

# Git/Github for Version Control 
- Git and Github are tools to track the complete history of your files.   

- They are very popular among programmers, but not so much among non-programmers. 
- Why? I believe it has to do with GUIs.

---

# What is a GUI and why the bad reputation

**G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface   

- For most of us (non-programmers): *GUI = Software*.  

- GUIs are behind the popularization of personal computers. 

- Unfortunately GUIs are pretty bad at keeping a record of actions taken (bad for reproducibility).

---

# What is not a GUI?

- Any software that is run in the command line (aka terminal, shell, bash, etc).  

![](Images/command_line.png)
  
- Git was designed to run in the command line.

- Today we will learn Git **without** the command line.

---

# What is Git 1/2

- Git is a software designed to track the **entire** history of the code of a project. 

- Designed originally for software development, it has gained important traction in the research community. 

- Main appeal: facilitates full reproducibility and collaboration. 

- Git is mainly meant to work as a non-GUI (in the command line) software.   
**However:** most of the key features can be used through a GUI. 

---

# What is Git 2/2

- By code git understands any type of plain text file (`myfile.R`, `myfile.do`, `.tex/.md/.txt/.csv/.etc`).

- This types of files can be understood as "human readable" as machine and human see the same fie. 

- Files that are "non-human readable" are called binary files (`myfile.docx`, `myfile.xlxs`, `.pdf/.exe/.dta/.etc`).

- Git can also detect changes in binary files, but it cannot show those changes.

---

# What is Github
- Github is a company that provides two services (that we care of): 
  - A web hosting service for all our files track with git (public free/private $ or free if academic).  
  - A GUI software (Desktop App) that provides user friendly access to git.

- Others hosting ss include: Bitbucket, GitLab, Gitkraken, etc. 

- Other GUIs include: SourceTree, Gitkraken, Atom, RStudio.

---

# The Primary Goal of Version Control (for us)

**The Goal:** keep track of any potentially meaningful modification to your code.  

--

**Secondary Goal:** Learn how to collaborate with others using Github.   

--

**Bonus track:** get you excited about using open source statistical software (R, Python, Julia, etc)

---
# Strategy 1:  
1 - Agree on a naming convention with you co-authors (eg: YYYYMMDDfilename_INITALS).  
2 - Begin working from the last saved version (eg: `20180325demo_FH.do`).  
3 - At the end of the day, save on a new version (eg: `20180327demo_FH.do`).  

**Pros:** Easy adoption.   

**Cons:** Error prone, hard to document, lots of files for each document.     

---

# Strategy 2:  
1 - Name your file `filename` (ideally `01_filename`)  
2 - Take a snapshot of your work every time you complete relevant change (day, hour or minutes).  
3 - Update your entire working folder to the cloud.   


**Pros:** Error proof, seamless documentation, one file per document, track differences across all versions, meant to work with the cloud. 

**Cons:** Harder adoption.

# Demos

## Five Demos: 

1 - **Simple but instructive.**   

2 - Repeat with branches.  
 
3 - Repeat with collaboration: pull requests.   

4 - Repeat with collaboration: shared ownership.   

5 - Explore a real life repo.    
---

# Demo #1: We Start in the Cloud 

1 -  Create [github.com](github.com) account and sign in.   
2 -  Let's look at some **repos**.   
3 -  First way to access content: download.   
4 -  What if you want to have your own copy of the repo? **Fork** it!.  
5 -  Now create your own repo. Initiate readme and make some edits.   

---
# Demo #1: We move to our local computer 

6 - Clone the it. Explore the files and location.   
7 - Create new files, edit. And commit. Edit again, and commit again.   
8 - Push. Edit on github.com, and pull.   
9 - For this tutorial, best way to access previous version: explore in github.com and download.


---
# Five Demos 2/5: 

1 - Simple but instructive.   
    *Review: def repo, github.com, download, clone, destination folder, fork, create repo, commit, push, pull, delete, search repo, download old version.*   

2 - **Repeat with branches.**  
 
3 - Repeat with collaboration: pull requests.   

4 - Repeat with collaboration: shared ownership.   

5 - Explore a real life repo.     
    
---
# Demo #2: Branches and collaboration (we wil be here a while)

1 - Create a branch from previous repo.  
2 - Add new content (do not replace), commit a few times, and go back and forth to the main branch.  
3 - Go back to main branch (master), observe file, merge.  
4 - Look at the history of the main branch.   
5 - Repeat 1-3 but now replace instead of adding content.

# Five Demos: 3/5 

1 - Simple but instructive.   
    Review: def repo, github.com, download, clone, destination folder, fork, create repo, commit, push, pull, delete, search repo, download old version.  
2 - Repeat with branches.  
    *Review: All of the above, plus: branch, merge, resolve conflicts.*  
3 - **Repeat with collaboration: pull requests.**  
4 - Repeat with collaboration: shared ownership.     
5 - Explore a real life repo.  


---
# Demo #3: Pull requests

1 - Fork repo [github.com/BITSS/test_birthday](https://github.com/BITSS/test_birthday), and clone it into your machine.  
2 - Edit fields of name, and birth date.   
3 - Save, commit and push.   
4 - Create your first **pull request**.   
5 - Let's see if I can manage all those pull requests very quickly (maybe illustrate issues).   
6 - Now find your neighbors repo of Demos 1 &amp; 2, fork it, clone it, make a change, save, commit, and...
 

---
# Two formats of collaboration  

- One owner, many pull requests.  
    - Easier to control, requires constant updating.   
- Many owners, all can push.   
    - **Very** important to pull at the beginning and at before each push. 

---
# Five Demos: 4/5 

1 - Simple but instructive.   
    Review: def repo, github.com, download, clone, destination folder, fork, create repo, commit, push, pull, delete, search repo, download old version.  
2 - Repeat with branches.  
    Review: All of the above, plus: branch, merge, resolve conflicts.   
3 - Repeat with collaboration: pull requests.   
    *Review: collaborate via fork + PR*  
4 - **Repeat with collaboration: shared ownership. **    
5 - Explore a real life repo.  


---
# Demo #4: Many owners
    
1. Half of you (\#1): go back to the repo of demo 1 &amp; 2 and invite a collaborator.  
(Suggestion: the "forker" creates the repo, the "forkee" is invited  
, edit, commit, push/pull)  
--

2. The other half (\#2): clones, commits and pushes.  
--

3. \#1 commits and pushes in **different lines**.    
--

4. Switch and repeat 2 &amp; 3: \#2 commits first and pushes, then \#1.    
--

5. Repeat 2 - 4 but now both of you in the same lines.    
--

6. Repeat now but with branches (optional).

1-  Find the following repo: `github.com/BITSS/opa-wealthtax`.   
2-  Fork it and clone it.    
3-  Open it in your computer: `opa-wealthtax.Rproj` (needs RStudio), look around and execute `code/dynamic_doc/wealth_tax_dd.Rmd`.  
4-  Find elasticities, fill in csv, document, submit.
5 - Find `code/interactive_visualization/server.R` and in line `1561` change `red` to `blue`

    *Review: All of the above, plus: how does a real-life example looks like.* 

---
# Now go and explore!
Some good habits:   
- Commit often (&lt;1hr)  
- Always pull before you start a new session of work. Also good to pull before pushing.    
- Think of your remote as the most important set of files. Get used to deleting things in your local machine.
