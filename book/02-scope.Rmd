# Scoping

In this first stage, students are assigned or choose a paper to reproduce. This section describes the different steps required to succesfully define the scope of a reproduction excercise. 

## Steps

Before you invest any time in reading/summarizing the paper: 

### Check ACRE records  
Check the [ACRE database](ADD LINK) for previous assessments of the same paper. If there is no previous assessment, create the first entry. If there are previous entries, check if the paper-status is "open to reproductions", and create a new entry^[If the paper appears as "closed to reproductions" it means that ACRE has documented interactions between previous reproductors and original authors, showing that it is not possible to access any further required materials. ].   

### Verify that reproduction materials exist  

Verify that the paper has reproduction materials. If yes, continue. If no, verify in our records if authors have been requested these materials before.  If nobody has submitted a similar request before, contact the authors using the language [suggested here](add link), make sure to CC (acre@berkeley.edu). If the authors have been contacted before and the information is still missing, submit a request for closing the paper for further reproductions and choose another paper. 

### Read and summarize the paper 

Read the paper and write a two-page summary: focus on what is the main question the paper answers, its methodology and data sources.    

### Declare scope of the excercise

Declare if assessment will be about all or main output, and if it aims to start from raw data, or analytic data.   

#### Reproduction margins  

Intensity of the reproduction: analytic or raw.  

##### Extensive margin: outputs to reproduced  
  - **Main results:** a successful reproduction of main results would have obtained the same estimates as in the original paper, for the estimates that the authors highlight the most in either the abstract, introduction or conclusion of the paper. If no estimate is highlighted, then the researcher conducting the reproduction should choose the main result and declare it at the begging of the reproduction.
  - **Complete:**  a successful reproduction is complete when it is possible to obtain the same estimates as the original study for all the outputs presented in the paper. This includes: tables, figures, and inline estimates both in the main body of the paper and all the appendices.   

###### Types of output:   
  - **Tables:** Describe how to cite record location. 
  - **Figures:**  
  - **In-line:**    


##### Intensive margin: depth of reproduction in terms of original data
 - **Raw data:** A data set is considered to be raw, if it corresponds to the a unmodified file that was obtained by the authors from the sources cited in the paper. The only possible modification that can be made to raw data, without changing its category to processed data, is that of deleting personally identifiable information.

 - **Processed data:** a raw data set that has gone through any transformation should be defined as processed data. Processed data can be separated into intermediate data and analytic data.
      - *Intermediate data:* a processed dataset is defined as intermediate if it is not directly used as final input for an analysis in the final paper (including appendix). Intermediate data should not contain direct identifiers.
      - *Analytic data:* data will be defined as analytic if it will be used as the last input in the workflow, to produce a statistic displayed in the final paper (including the appendix).

###### How to classify a data set?
To classify a data set as **raw** you can use some of the following strategies:    

 - Check if the data is stored in a folder denominated as "raw"  
 - Check if the filename has the word "raw" in some part of it  
 - Verify that the data set is not the output of any code script in the reproduction materials  
 - Verify that the same file can be independently obtained from the data source cited in the paper  

To classify a data set as **analytic** you can use some of the following strategies:   

 - Check if the data is stored in a folder denominated as "analytic" or "analysis"  
 - Check if the filename has the word "analytic" or "analysis" in some part of it  
 - Verify that the data set is the last input required to produce some of the output (formatted or unformatted) of the paper  


## Recording the results of scoping  

Complete [survey one](https://berkeley.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8hLHNI6LGSYchEN).  

## Sample strategies for scoping  

### Strategy 1: 

- First main estimates from paper.

- Then main 2 main tables and/or two main figures.

- Once done with improvements stage of these outcomes, then go back to rest of the paper.    

### Strategy 2:  

 - get everything to run up to analytic data, then go to improvements. Once completed go back for raw data (or in parallel?)
