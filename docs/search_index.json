Exchanges that contain charged or adversarial language can damage professional relationships and hamper scientific progress. Janz and Freese (2019) articulate two important steps reproducers can take to ensure their interactions with original authors are constructive. We provide a summary below and encourage you to follow this guidance. Remember the golden rule of reproductions (and replications): treat others and their work, as you would like others to treat you and your work! 1. Carefully and transparently plan your study. Clearly state that you are conducting a reproduction of the original work. Explain why you have chosen this study. Explain how “far” your results must deviate from the original work before claiming that the study could not be reproduced. Engage deeply with the substantive literature to ensure that your interpretation of differences between the original and reproduction is thorough and acceptable to other authors in the field. 2. Use professional and sensitive language. Discuss potential discrepancies between your work and the original paper just like you would have done for your own work. Avoid binary judgments and statements like “failed to reproduce.” Clearly state which results reproduced and which did not (e.g., “we successfully reproduced X, but failed to reproduce Y”) unless you uncover apparent scientific misconduct (e.g. see Broockman, Kalla and Aronow, 2015). [FH: last sentence seems broken] Talk about the study, not the author, to avoid making it personal. Make clear what the positive contribution of the original article is. Consider sending a copy of your reproduction report to the original authors. Discuss what your reproduction contributes to the literature, and refrain from claiming to give the final answer to the question. For papers published five or more years ago, be mindful that norms for reproducibility have evolved since then. Remember, the goal is not to criticize previous work or hunt for errors, but to move the literature forward! To help put these recommendations into practice, we provide template language for common scenarios that reproducers and authors may encounter in their interactions. While we hope that you find these useful, note that they are only recommendations, and you are welcome to modify them based on the context and needs of your specific project. Feel free to contact us if you need more guidance or would like to provide feedback on these materials (acre@berkeley.edu). 5.1 For Reproducers Contacting the Authors of the Original Study Consider the following before you contact the original author: Carefully read all footnotes, appendices, tables, captions, etc. to learn if, how, and where reproduction materials are provided. Follow this Data and Code Guidance to determine whether you have everything before you start. A few things to consider: A Readme file, if available, would be a good place to start. All papers published in AEA journals after July 2019 should have such documentation. Check whether there are any restrictions to accessing the data or code, and whether there are instructions on how to access these files for the purpose of reproduction. If a reproduction package is not readily available in the location where the article is published (e.g., the journal website), check the authors’ websites, Dataverse profiles, the ICPSR Publications Related Archive, and other relevant archives and/or data repositories. If steps 1 and 2 don’t work, contact the corresponding author (copying the co-authors, if any), consolidating your requests into as few emails as possible. In your email, make sure to include the following details: Basic information about the paper being reproduced (include title, version, date, and a DOI link (or just a URL)); Context for the reproduction (as part of a class exercise, thesis, etc.) and a notice that the outcome will be recorded in the ACRE reproducibility database; Items from the reproduction package that are missing, as well as locations where you had (unsuccessfully) searched for them; Use plan: Will the materials be used exclusively for this project? Ask for permission to share the data publicly. Right to consultation and results: Will you share the outcome of the reproduction exercise with the original authors? A deadline to respond (we suggest at least two weeks). Follow up if you don’t get a response within two weeks (or whatever deadline you set), and include any details or clarifications that were left out in your first email. Record the outcome of your interaction with the original author in the ACRE database. You can qualify the outcome as one of the following: A complete reproduction package was provided An incomplete reproduction package was provided. You can also select one of the following reasons: Data is of sensitive, confidential, or proprietary character and cannot be shared; Data is of sensitive, confidential, or proprietary character, but access instructions were provided. Author refused to share the reproduction package Author did not respond (including after a reminder was sent) within 4 weeks after the initial request. 5.1.1 Contacting the original author(s) when there is no reproduction package If you haven’t been able to locate an entry of a reproduction *Template email:** Subject: Reproduction package for [“Title of the paper”] Dear Dr. [Lastname of Corresponding Author], I am contacting you to request a reproduction package for your paper titled [Title] which was published in [Journal] in [year] (vol [volume], no. [no.]), [link]. A reproduction package may contain (raw and/or analytic) data, code, and other documentation that makes it possible to reproduce paper. Would you be able to share any of these items? I am a [graduate student/postdoc/other position] at [Institution], and I would like to reproduce the results, tables, and other figures using the reproduction materials mentioned above. I have chosen this paper because [add context for why you want to reproduce this particular paper using neutral language (e.g., &quot;This is a seminal paper in my field&quot;), avoiding any statements that would put the respondent on the defensive]. Unfortunately, I was not able to locate any of these materials on the journal website, Dataverse [or other data and code repositories], or in your paper. I will record the result of my reproduction attempt on the Advancing Computational Reproducibility in Economics (ACRE) platform, which is an open-source repository to systematically source, collect and present the results of verifications of computational reproducibility of published work in economics. With your permission, I will also record the materials you share with me, which would allow access for other reproducers and avoid repeated requests directed to you. Please let me know if there are any legal or ethical restrictions that apply to all or parts of the reproduction materials so that I can take that into consideration during this exercise. In addition to your response above, would you be available to respond future (non-repetitive) inquieries from me or other reproducers conducting an ACRE excercise? Though your cooperation with mine and/or future request would be extremely helpful, please note that you are not required to comply. Since I am required to complete this project by [date], I would appreciate your response by [deadline]. Let me know if you have any questions. Please also feel free to contact my supervisor/instructor [Name (email)] for further details on this exercise. Thank you in advance for your help! Best regards, [Reproducer] 5.1.2 Contacting the original author(s) to request specific missing items of a reproduction package Template email: Subject: Reproduction materials for [“Title of the paper”] Dear Dr. [Lastname of Corresponding Author], I am contacting you about reproduction materials for your paper titled [Title] which was published in [Journal] in [year] (vol [volume], no. [no.]), [link]. I am a [graduate student/postdoc/other position] at [Institution], and I’m working to reproduce this paper as part of a class exercise. [Add context for why you want to reproduce this particular paper using neutral language (e.g., &quot;This is a seminal paper in my field&quot;), avoiding any statements that would put the respondent on the defensive]. To be able to reproduce the paper in full, I hope that you can share the following items: [list items missing from reproduction package, preferably bulleted if more than one (raw/analytic data, code, protocols for conducting the experiment, etc.)]. I have already searched [locations where you searched for items, with links provided], however I was not able to locate the items there. You can be assured that I will not share any of the materials without your permission, and I will use them exclusively for the purpose of this exercise. Let me know if there are any legal or ethical restrictions that apply to all or parts of the reproduction materials so that I can take that into consideration during this exercise. Note that I will record the outcome of my reproduction on the Advancing Computational Reproducibility in Economics (ACRE) platform, an online catalog of reproduction projects in economics. ACRE is hosted by the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (BITSS). Let me know if you would like me to share the outcome of my exercise with you and whether you are interested in providing a response. Since I am required to complete this project by [date], I would appreciate your response by [deadline]. Let me know if you have any questions. Please also feel free to contact my supervisor/instructor [Name (email)] for further details on this exercise. Thank you in advance for your help! Best regards, [Reproducer] 5.1.3 Asking for additional guidance when some materials have been shared Note: Even when a corresponding author has shared a reproduction package, you may still run into challenges in interpreting or executing the materials. That shouldn’t discourage you from asking the corresponding author to provide clarifications or share missing materials. As in the previous scenario described above, demonstrate that you made an honest effort to reproduce the work using the available resources and try to consolidate your requests into as few emails as possible. Template email: Subject: Clarification for reproduction materials for [“Title of the paper”] Dear Dr. [Lastname of Corresponding Author], Thank you for sharing the materials. They have been immensely helpful for my work. Unfortunately, I ran into a few issues as I delved into the reproduction exercise, and I think your guidance would be helpful in resolving them. [Describe the issues and how you have tried to resolve them. Describe whatever files or parts of the data or code are missing. Refer to examples 1 and 2 below for more details]. Thank you in advance for your help. Best regards, [Reproducer] 1: An example of well described issues: Specifically, I am attempting to reproduce OUTPUT X (e.g., table 1, figure 3). I found that the following components are required to reproduce to reproduce OUTPUT X: OUTPUT X └───[code] formatting_table1.R ├───output1_part1.txt | └───[code] output_table1.do | └───[data] analysis_data01.csv | └───[code] data_cleaning01.R* | └───[data] UNKNOWN └───output1_part2.txt └───[code] output_table2.do └───[data] analysis_data02.csv └───[code] data_cleaning02.R └───[data] admin_01raw.csv* I have marked with an asterix (*) the items that I could not find in the reproduction materials: data_cleaning01.R and admin_01raw.csv. After accessing these files, I will also be able to identify the name of the raw data set required to obtain output1_part1.txt. This is to let you know that I may need to contact you again if I cannot find this file (labeled as UNKNOWN above) in the reproduction materials. I understand that this request will require some work for you or somebody in your research group, but I want to assure you that I will add these missing files to the reproduction package for your paper on the ACRE platform. Doing this will ensure that you will not be asked twice for the same missing file. 2. An example of poorly described issues: Your paper does not reproduce. I have tried for several hours now, and can’t get the DO files to run. Could you please share all the missing reproduction materials? Data and code sharing are a basic principle of open science, so I am confident that you will do the right thing. 5.1.4 Response when the original author has refused to share due to undisclosed reasons Note: You can also use this template if a corresponding author has not submitted a response after two or more follow-up emails. Template email: Subject: Re: Reproduction materials for `[“Title of the paper”] Dear Dr. [Last Name of Corresponding Author], Thank you for considering my request. I will try to reproduce the paper using the available materials, and will record the missing items accordingly on the ACRE platform. l will also post my assessment of the reproducibility of the paper in its current form based on the ACRE reproducibility scale. Let me know if you have any questions. Best regards, [Reproducer] 5.1.5 Response when the original author has refused to share due to legal or ethical restrictions of the data Template email: Subject: Re: Reproduction materials for [“Title of the paper”] Dear Dr. [Last Name of Corresponding Author], Thank you for your response and for clarifying the terms of use of the reproduction materials. Though I understand that you are unable to share the raw data, there may be alternative steps you can take that would help me improve the reproducibility of your paper. These include: Sharing the analytic version of the data (the version of the dataset that was used in the final version of your paper); Providing a public description of the steps other researchers can follow to request access to the raw data or materials, including an estimate of the costs and the duration of the process. Find examples of data availability statements for proprietary or restricted-access data here; and Providing access to all data and materials for which the constraints do not apply. Based on my assessment, your paper would currently rank at [level X] on the ACRE reproducibility scale, however this score can be easily improved. Being able to provide analytic data would elevate the reproducibility of your paper to [level Y]. Providing public instructions on how other parties can access the data would further elevate its reproducibility to [level Z]. I would be happy to help if you are interested in taking any of the steps I outlined above. Let me know if that would be helpful. Thank you for your help! Best regards, [Reproducer] 5.1.6 Contacting the original author to share the results of your reproduction exercise Note: Reporting the results of reproductions is probably the most contentious part of the process, particularly in instances where the reproducer is not able to fully reproduce the paper or finds significant deviations from the original work. However, if the reproduction can correctly identify the sources of such deviations, it may be viewed as an improved version of the original work. Regardless of the outcome of the reproduction exercise, the guidance from the introduction of this chapter still stands here: reproduce the work of others as you would like for others to reproduce yours, and make sure that is reflected in how you discuss any discrepancies between your and the original work. Template email: Subject: Reproducibility Assessment of [“Title of the paper”] Dear Dr. [Last Name of Corresponding Author], Thank you for your support throughout my project as I worked to verify and advance the reproducibility of [Paper]. I’m writing now to share the results of my project with you and invite your feedback. The results of each step of my exercise, include i) Assessment, ii) Improvements, iii) Robustness Checks, (and iv) Extensions, if applicable). `[Include the following items in the body of your email: Briefly describe which parts of the paper you tried to reproduce (e.g. a specific estimate, a table, etc.). Within the scope of your reproduction, describe exactly which items you managed to reproduce. Discuss the differences you observed between the results of your reproduction and the original work, and demonstrate that you did your due diligence in trying to reproduce the item. Remember that it is more constructive to discuss discrepancies, differences or deviations, rather than errors, mistakes or failures, and always talk about the work – not the author! Use sensitive language when presenting discrepancies, e.g. “Unfortunately, I found X, which differs from the Y result in the original paper…”. Be cognizant of any potential limitations of your work, and explain how you have tried to address them – that way you will proactively address potential criticism! Describe how you tried to improve, the reproducibility of the paper. If some of the improvements are based on discretionary judgment (e.g. file organization or code commenting), try to explain why you think they are an upgrade over the original work. If you didn’t make improvements, point out some concrete steps that the author(s) can take to improve the reproducibility of the section you reproduced.]` I look forward to your questions, comments, and suggestions on what I laid out above. As discussed previously, I will record the outcomes of my exercise, along with the improvements, on the ACRE platform. Best regards, [Reproducer] 5.1.7 Responding to hostile responses from original authors Note: Planning your study carefully and transparently, and using professional and sensitive language are the best ways to ensure that the interaction will be beneficial to both you and the original author. However, unpleasant interactions may happen despite your best efforts, and can range anywhere from dismissive comments to bullying, discrimination, and harassment. 5.1.7.1 Dismissive comments In cases of dismissive comments, the best course of action may be to simply thank the author for their response and continue with the exercise. Template email: Subject: Re: Reproduction materials for `[“Title of the paper”] Dear Dr. [Last Name of Corresponding Author], Thank you for your response. I will work to reproduce using the available materials, and will record my results accordingly on the ACRE platform. l will also post my assessment of the reproducibility of the paper in its current form based on the ACRE reproducibility scale. Let me know if you have any questions. Best regards, [Reproducer] 5.1.7.2 Harassment and/or discrimination The AEA and other economic societies have strict policies against harassment and discrimination. Here are some of the behaviors that the AEA Policy on Harassment and Discrimination has listed as unacceptable, and could emerge in a hostile exchange regarding a reproduction: Intentionally intimidating, threatening, harassing, or abusive actions or remarks (both spoken and in other media) Prejudicial actions or comments that undermine the principles of equal opportunity, fair treatment, or free academic exchange Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following Real or implied threat of physical harm. Here are a some steps you can take if you believe you have experienced bullying, discrimination or harassment: File a complaint with the AEA Ombudsperson. Any AEA member can file a complaint (you can also join the AEA solely for the purpose of filing a report). The person about whom you are making the complaint need not be an AEA member. A non-AEA member can also file a report if the act of harassment or discrimination was committed by an AEA member or in the context of an AEA-sponsored activity. Learn more about the process here. File a report with your institution’s office for the prevention of harassment &amp; discrimination. US-based institutions have internal mechanisms that allow students and faculty to seek support in cases of discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, color, national origin, gender, age, or sexual orientation/identity, including allegations of sexual harassment and sexual violence. Formal titles of this office vary across institutions, but common names include “Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination” (in institutions that are part of the University of California system), “Office of Equity and Title IX”, etc. Contact your institution’s Ombudsperson/Ombuds Office. If you believe that you have experienced academic bullying or other forms of disrespectful behavior that fall outside the scope of harassment and/or discrimination as described above, you should know that university ombuds officers are a confidential, impartial resource to discuss your concerns and learn about potential next steps available in your case. Access mental health services at your institution. Many universities offer short-term Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (CAPS) for academic, career, and personal issues. Ask for support from your academic supervisor. If you are unsure on how to proceed, consult your academic supervisor on whether continuing the exercise would be appropriate. 5.2 For Original Authors Responding to Requests from Reproducers [Aleks: would it be possible for you to work on this next week (3/30)?] 5.2.1 Responding to a repeated request [TO DO] 5.2.2 Acknowledging that some information is missing [TO DO] 5.2.3 Acknowledging that some material is still embargoed for future research [TO DO] 5.2.4 Responding to incomplete/aggressive requests from reproducer "]
