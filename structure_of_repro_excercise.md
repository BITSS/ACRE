Steps:  
1 - Read the paper and identify main causal claims (10%)  

2 - Conduct reproduction: (up to 60%)  
  - Review and classify the replication materials: data (raw and analytic) and code
  (cleaning and analysis). Assess current category of computational reproducibility  
  - Contribute to increase the CR of the paper
       - Obtaining data/code
       - Creating code
       - Debugging code
       - Overall quality improvement (folders, LP, OS)
  - ID possible analytical choices


3 - Test the robustness of results to alternative (sensible) specifications (at least 30%)
  - ID sensible analytical choices
  - Sample from sensible and re-run: report how much do result change as
    fraction of standard deviations.

Final products:
 -  Two-page summary of paper
 -  One-page introduction describing why you chose this paper
 -  2 Completed surveys:  
      i  - General information about the paper and specific
      information about output to reproduce.  
      ii - Assessment of how (computationally) reproducible is the paper;
       description of improvements to its reproducibility; record of all the
       analytical choices identified in the exercise.
 -  Narrated description of improvements to original CR of the paper, assessment
    of robustness of results. Lessons from the exercise and possible future
    extensions.
