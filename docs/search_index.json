You will verify whether or not a reproduction package for your candidate paper exists. We define a reproduction package (sometimes referred to as a “replication package”) as the collection of all materials that make it possible for a reproducer to reproduce the paper. This package may contain data, code, and/or documentation. If your candidate paper has a reproduction package, only then it will become your declared paper. If your candidate paper does not have a reproduction package you will be asked to leave a brief record in the ACRE database (under current development), and choose another candidate paper. If you still want to explore the reproducibility of a paper with no reproduciton package, these guidelines will provide instructions on how contact the authors with a specific request for materials to create a public reproduction package, or if this route proves unsuccesful, on how to build your reproduction package from scratch. In this stage, you are not expected to review the reproduction materials in detail, as you will dedicate most of your time to this in later stages of the exercise. If materials are available, you will read the paper and declare the scope of the reproduction exercise. You can expect to spend between 1-3 days in the Scoping stage. Use Survey 1 to record your work for this stage. 1.1 From candidate to declared paper 1.1.1 Select a candidate paper or be assigned one (several weeks before starting the excercise). The first step is to identify a candidate paper. You might be able to choose among a pool of paper assinged by your instructor, or might be assigned a specific paper. In any case, it is important ot highlight that this might not be your final paper. It can be the case that you will not find any reproduction package and switch to another paper. The distinction between candidate and declared paper is meant to track precicely this circunstances. Verifiy the existence of a reproduction package by going through these steps (stop whenever you find the reproduction package): Verify the existence of a previous entry on ACRE (under construction) on your candidate paper. Check the paper’s webpage in the official journal or publisher website. Look for links similar to “Data and Materials”, “Supplemnetal Materials”, “Reproduction/Replication Package/Materials”. Look for links in the paper (review footnotes and appendices). Review the authors personal websites. Once you have cover steps 1-4 and have not find any reproduction materials, then we suggest you contact the authors. We strongly encourage you to contact authors several weeks before officially starting the main parts of Scoping stage of this exercise. Instructors should also plan to use the ACRE exercise accordingly (eg. if the reproducction is expected to take place in the middle of the semester, students should plan on contacting the authors of a missing reproduction package on the first few weeks of the semester. 1.1.2 Verify existence of reproduction package for candidate paper At this point you are only validating the existence of (at least) one reproduction package and not assessing the quality of its content. Check the ACRE database (under development) for previous assessments of your candidate paper. If there are previous entries, you will see a brief report card with the following information: 1.1.3 Decision Tree to Move From Candidate to Declared Paper If there is no paper entry, create one. Two possible scenarios: A reproduction package exists. In this case, the candidate paper becomes the declare paper and reproducers can move on to next section (read the paper). If no RP exists, then reproducers have the option to contact the original authors following the ACRE recomendations. If authors are not contacted, reproducers are ask to leave a record in the ACRE plataform (as “original reproduction package is not available, and authors were not contacted”), and select a new candidate paper. If authors are contacted, there are two possible results: A reproduction package was provided. In this case, the candidate paper becomes the declare paper and reproducers can move on to next section (read the paper). A reproduction package was not provided.Reproducers will have the final option of independently building a reproduction package (finding data and writing code independently). If they decide to not build a reproduction package independetly, reproducers are ask to leave a record in the ACRE plataform (as “original reproduction package is not available, and authors were contacted”), and select a new candidate paper. If they decide to build a reproduction package independently, the candidate paper becomes the declare paper and reproducers can move on to next section. Box 1: Summary Report Card for ACRE Paper Entry Title: Sample Title Authors: Jane Doe &amp; John Doe Original Reproduction Package Available: URL/No [If “No”] Contacted Authors?: Yes/No [If “Yes(contacted)”] Type of Response: Categories (6). Additional Reproduction Packages: Number (eg., 2) Authors Available for Further Questions for ACRE Reproductions: Yes/No/Unknown Open for reproductions: Yes/No If there is at least one entry ACRE on the candidate paper, reproducers will be able to see the informations presented in Box 1. If a reproduction package exists, the candidate paper becomes the declare paper and reproducers can move on to next section (read the paper). If there is no reproduction package, and authors have not been contacted, reproducer should follow the same instructions from above regarding contacting authors. If there is no reproduction package, and authors have been contacted, reprocuders should observe the authors availability to be contacted for follow-ups. If authors asked to not been contacted any further, reproducers will have the options of building the RP independently or choosing a new candidate paper (after leaving a brief record). If authors allowed future follow-ups, reproducers could choose to follow up, build their own RP independently or switch to a new candidate paper (after leaving a brieg record) If there are not enough materials to pursue a reproduction, you will be asked to create a short entry in the ACRE platform (no more than 5 minutes) and select a new candidate paper. Repeat this step until you have found a paper with a reproduction package – this will be your declared paper and you will try to reproduce it for the remainder of the ACRE exercise. Do not invest time in doing a detailed read of any paper until you are sure that it is your declared paper. Verify that the paper has a reproduction package that contains at least some materials. If there is no reproduction package, use our records to check if requests to authors have been made before requesting materials from original authors. If no one has submitted a similar request, you can contact the authors using language suggested here. Alternatively, you can simply choose a different paper and record the candidate paper at the beginning of Survey 1. Before contacting the authors, we recommend that you review and use language from Chapter 6: Communications guidance below. If the authors provide any materials, deposit them in a trusted repository (for example Open Science Framework, Open ICPSR, or Dataverse) and deposit all these materials under the name Original reproduction package for - Title of the paper. Provide the URL of the repository in Survey 1. If you fail to obtain the reproduction package and would like to choose a different paper, please record this in the “abandoned reproduction” section of Survey 1. When the materials are provided in the original publication, they will be labeled as “the original reproduction package”. If they are later created by a reproducer, they will be referred to as “reproducer X’ reproduction package”. Now that you have verified the existence of a reproduction package, your candidate paper is now your declared paper. You can now move forward with the exercise! View Decision Tree To Select Paper (Emma: add title) 1.2 Scoping your declared paper 1.2.1 Read and summarize the paper. Depending on how much time you have, we recommend that you write a short summary of the paper. This will help remind you of the key elements to focus on for the reproduction, and to demonstrate your understanding of the paper (for yourself and others like your instructor/advisor). When reading/summarizing the paper, you should try to answer the following main questions: Would you classify the paper’s scientific claims as mainly focused on estimating a causal relationship, estimating/predicting a descriptive statistic of a population, or something else? How many scientific claims (descriptive or causal) are investigated in the paper? What is the population for which the estimates apply? What is the main population that is the focus of the paper as a whole? What are the main data sources used in the paper? How many outputs are in the paper (tables, figures and inline results)? What is the main statistical or econometric method used to examine each claim? What is the author’s preferred specification (or yours if authors are not clear)? What are some robustness checks to the preferred specification? 1.2.2 Record scope of the exercise. By now you should have selected a paper that contains a reproduction package, and have a fairly good understanding of the content of the paper. You do not, however, need to have spent any time reviewing the reproduction package in detail. At this point, you should clearly specify which part of the paper will be the main focus of your reproduction excercise1. You are asked to focus on specific estimates, represented by a unique combination of claim-output-specification, that represent the authors’ preferred specification for a given claim (or yours). If you plan to scope more than one claim, we strongly recommend starting with one and recording your results. You can initiate another record in ACRE later for the second (or third, etc.) claim to reproduce, using the materials and knowledge you developed in the first exercise. Declare specific main estimates to reproduce. Identify one of the scientific claims, and its corresponding preferred specification, and record its magnitude, standard error, and location in the paper (page, table #, and row and column in the table). If the authors did not explicitly choose a particular estimate, you will be asked to select one. In addition to the preferred estimate, you will be asked to reproduce up to five estimates that correspond to alternative specifications of the preferred estimate. Declare possible robustness checks to main estimates (optional). After reading the paper, you might wonder why the authors did not conduct a specific robustness test. If you think that such analysis could have been done within the same methodology, and using the same data (eg., including/excluding a subset of the data like “high-school dropouts” or “women”), please specify a robustness test that you would like to test before starting the assessment stage. These are the elements you will need to conduct the scoping stage. You now have all the elements necesary to complete Survey 1. Bonus: Identify your relevant timeline. Before you begin working on the three main stages of the reproduction exercise (assessment, improvement, and robustness), it is important to manage expectations (yours and those of your instructor/advisor). Be mindful of your time limitations when defining the scope of your reproduction activity. These will depend on the type of exercise chosen by your instructor/advisor, and may vary from a homework assignment (e.g., over a couple of weeks), to a longer class project that that may take a month to complete or a semester-long project (for example as an undergraduate thesis). Table 1 shows a tentative distribution of time across three different reproduction formats. The scoping and assessment stages are expected to last roughly the same amount of time across all formats (lasting longer for the semester-long activities, expecting less experience with research if the reproducer is an undergraduate student). Differences emerge in the distribution of time for the last two main stages: Improvements and Robustness. For shorter exercises, we recommend staying away from any possible improvements to the raw data (or cleaning code). This will limit how many robustness checks are possible (for example, by limiting your ability to reconstruct variables according to slightly different definitions), but it should leave plenty of time for testing different specifications at the analysis level. .tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;} .tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;} .tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;} .tg .tg-baqh{text-align:center;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-c3ow{border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-dvpl{border-color:inherit;text-align:right;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-0lax{text-align:left;vertical-align:top} 2 weeks (~10 days) 1 month (~20 days) 1 semester (~100 days) analysis data raw data analysis data raw data analysis data raw data Scoping 10% (1 day) 5% (1 day) 3% (3 days) Assessment 25% 15% 7% Improvement 20% 0% 40% 20% 30% Robustness 30% 10% 30% 30% Extension 5% 0% 10% 10% Paper on PBR.
