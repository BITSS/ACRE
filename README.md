# Advancing Computational Reproducibility in Economics (ACRE)

## Guidelines  

This site contains supporting materials to
support the standardization of exercise of computational reproducibility in economics.

Something about the constructive philosophy of the ACRE approach.

It is target to students reproducing papers as parts of their graduate coursework (2nd year +) or undergraduate thesis.

 - [01_definitions.md](01_definitions.md) provides key definitions to assess computational reproducibility and to identify possibilities to improve the current level of reproducibility.  

 - [02_structure_of_excercise.md](02_structure_of_excercise.md) describes the main components behind a standardized reproducibility exercise, and the main products that the researcher conducting the reproduction will generate.    

 - [03_structure_of_report.md](03_structure_of_report.md) outlines the contents of the ACRE report that each reproducer will generate at the end of their exercise.   

 - [04_requirements_comprehension.md](04_requirements_comprehension.md) outlines mechanisms to test that the reproducer understood the paper and the materials for reproduction.   

- [05_contact_authors.md](05_contact_authors.md) provides sample language for students use when contacting original authors for specifics issues.  

- [06_sample_diagrams.md](06_sample_diagrams.md) provides examples of diagrams that connect output to input for different levels of reproducibility.
