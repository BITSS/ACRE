[["scoping.html", "Chapter 2 Scoping 2.1 Read and summarize the paper 2.2 Record a revised reproduction package 2.3 Record scope of the exercise", " Chapter 2 Scoping At this stage, you will define the scope of the reproduction by identifying the scientific claims and related display items that you will analyze in the remainder of the reproduction. For this exercise, we define a claim as a single major finding in a paper (usually featured in the abstract) and the details of the methods and results that support this finding. A claim is usually not equivalent to a single hypothesis or an entire paper, though there may be exceptions. A display item is a figure or table that presents the results described in the paper. Each display item contains several specifications. Note: once you progress past the Scoping stage on the SSRP, you will no longer be able to edit your responses in the Scoping stage, though you will be able to see them. This is because the content of later stages of the reproduction is dependent on the information you record at this stage of the reproduction. 2.1 Read and summarize the paper Depending on your reproductions timeline, we recommend that you write a short (&lt;1000 words) summary of the paper. Writing up such a summary will help you develop and demonstrate a wholesome understanding of the paper and its various components. In your summary, try to address the following: How many scientific claims can you identify in the paper? Would you classify the claims as causal, descriptive (e.g., estimating a populations descriptive statistic), or something else? What is the population that is the focus of the paper as a whole? What is the population for which the estimates apply? What are the primary data sources used in the paper? How many display items are there in the paper (tables, figures, and inline results)? What is the primary statistical or econometric method used to examine each claim? What is the authors preferred specification (or yours, if the authors is unclear)? What are some possible robustness checks for the preferred specification? Draft the summary in a plain text editor and paste the text in the form. 2.2 Record a revised reproduction package At the previous stage, you recorded the original reproduction package made available by the papers authors. Given that one of the main goals of the ACRe approach is to improve reproducibility, we recommend that you build an alternative reproduction package that will improve the reproducibility of specific display items or the paper as a whole. You can start by downloading the reproduction package (or forking, if on GitHub) and uploading a copy titled Revised reproduction package for [Paper Title] to a trusted repository. Examples of trusted repositories include Dataverse, openICPSR, Figshare, Dryad, Zenodo, Open Science Framework and others. We encourage you to use version control software (e.g., Git) during your reproductions. As you work through the next stages, you can modify the reproduction package and record your improvements on the SSRP. Keeping a record of such changes will help you (e.g., document your assessments or communicate with the original authors), and it will likely also allow future reproducers to build on top of your work. 2.3 Record scope of the exercise By now, you should have a reasonably good understanding of the paper. You do not, however, need to spend any time reviewing the reproduction package in detail. At this point, you should specify the parts of the paper that will be the main focus of your reproduction. Focus on specific estimates, represented by a unique combination of claim-display item-specification as represented in figure ??. Given the complexity of the SSRP approach, unless you are very familiar with the paper, we recommend starting with just one claim before moving onto second or third as part of a later reproduction. Declare a specific estimate(s) to reproduce Identify a scientific claim and its corresponding preferred specification, and record its magnitude, standard error, and location in the paper (page, table #, and table row and column). If the authors did not explicitly choose a precise preferred estimate, you can choose one yourself. In addition to the preferred estimate, you can reproduce up to five estimates that correspond to the preferred estimates alternative specifications. Declare possible robustness checks for main estimates (optional) After reading the paper, you might wonder why the authors did not conduct a specific robustness test. If you think that such analysis could have been done within the same methodology and using the same data (e.g., by including or excluding a subset of the data like high-school dropouts or women), please specify a robustness test that you would like to conduct before starting the Assessment stage.
