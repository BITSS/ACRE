# Assessment

The goal of this stage is to conduct a standardized assessment of your chosen paper’s computational reproducibility. This stage is designed to record as much of the learning process behind a reproduction as possible. Such a record facilitates future incremental improvements, allowing new reproducers to pick up where others have left off.


First, you will provide a detailed description of the reproduction package. Second, you will connect the outputs you’ve chosen to reproduce with their corresponding inputs. With these elements in place, you can score the level of reproducibility of each output, and report on paper-level dimensions of reproducibility.  

In the Scope stage you declared a paper, identified the specific claims you will be reproducing, and record the main estimates that support such claim. In this stage, you will identify all the outputs that contain those estimates. You will have to decide if you are interested in assessing the reproducibility of that entire output (e.g. "Table 1"), or focused only on the pre-specified estimates (e.g. "rows 3 and 4 of Table 1"). Additionally, you will be able to include other outputs of interest in your assessment. 

**Use [Survey 2](https://berkeley.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2gd9Y3XVtjLpZL7) to record your work as part of this step.**

*Tip:* We recommend that you first focus on one specific output (e.g. “Table 1”). After completing the assessment for this output, you will have a much easier time translating improvements to other outputs.


## Describe the inputs. {#describe-inputs}
This section explains how to list *all* the input materials found or referred to in the reproduction package. First, you’ll identify data sources and connect them with their raw data files (when available). Second, you’ll locate and provide a brief description of the analytic data files. Finally, you’ll locate, inspect, and describe the analytic code used in the paper.

The following terms will be used in this section:     
  
 -	**Cleaning code:** A script associated primarily with data cleaning. Most of its content is dedicated to actions such as deleting variables or observations, merging data sets, removing outliers, or reshaping the structure of the data (from long to wide or vice versa).  
  
 -	**Analysis code:** A script associated primarily with analysis. Most of its content is dedicated to actions such as running regressions, running hypothesis tests, computing standard errors, and imputing missing values.



### Describe the data sources and raw data. {#desc-sourc} 

In the paper to be reproduced, find references to all *data sources* used in the analysis. A data source is usually described in narrative form. For example, if the body of the paper uses text like “…for earnings in 2018 we use the Current Population Survey…”, the data source is “Current Population Survey 2018”. If it is mentioned for the first time on page 1 of the Appendix, its location should be recorded as “A1”. Do this for all data sources mentioned in the paper.   

Data sources also vary by unit of analysis, with some sources matching the same unit of analysis used in the paper (as in previous examples), while others are less clear (e.g., "our information on regional minimum wages comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics." This should be recorded as "regional minimum wages from the Bureau of Labor Statistics".).

Next look at the reproduction package and map the *data sources* mentioned in the paper to the *data files* in the available materials. Record their folder locations relative to the main reproduction folder^[relative location takes the form `/folder_in_rep_materials/sub_folder/file.txt`, in contrast to an absolute location that has the form `username/documents/projects/repros/folder_in_rep_materials/sub_folder/file.txt`]. In addition to looking at the existing data files, we recommend you review the first lines of all code files (especially cleaning code), looking for lines that call the data sets. Inspecting these scripts may help you understand how different data sources are used, and possibly identify any files missing from the reproduction package.

Record this information in a [standardized spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LUIdVFH0OfR70C7z07TYeE-uWzKI_JIeWUMaYhqEKK0/edit#gid=0&range=A1) with the following structure:

          |----------------------|------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|

### Describe the analytic data sets. {#desc-analy}

List all the analytic files you can find in the reproduction package, and identify their locations relative to the main reproduction folder. Record this information in a [standardized spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LUIdVFH0OfR70C7z07TYeE-uWzKI_JIeWUMaYhqEKK0/edit#gid=1299317837&range=A1).

As you progress through the exercise, add to the spreadsheet a one-line description of each file's main content (for example: `all_waves.csv` has the simple description `data for region-level analysis`). This may be difficult in an initial review, but will become easier as you go along.

The resulting report will have the following structure:  


          Analysis data information:
          |----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
          | analysis_data  | location              | description                    |
          |----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
          | final_data.csv | /analysis/fig1/       | data for figure1               |
          |----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
          | all_waves.csv  | /final_data/v1_april/ | data for region-level analysis |
          |----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
          | ...            | ...                   | ...                            |
          |----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|


### Describe the code scripts.{#desc-scripts}

List all code files that you find in the reproduction package and identify their locations relative to the master reproduction folder. Review the beginning and end of each code file and identify the inputs required to successfully run the file. Inputs may include data sets or other code scripts that are typically found at the beginning of the script (e.g., `load`, `read`, `source`, `run`, `do` ). For each code file, record all inputs together and separate each item with ";". Outputs may include other data sets, figures, or plain text files that are typically at the end of a script (e.g., `save`, `write`, `export`). For each code file, record all outputs together and separate each item with ";". Provide a one-line description of what each code file does. Record all this information in the [standardized spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LUIdVFH0OfR70C7z07TYeE-uWzKI_JIeWUMaYhqEKK0/edit#gid=1617799822&range=A1) with the following structure:


          |-------------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------|
          | file_name         | location         | inputs              | outputs             | description          | primary_type |

          |                   |                  |                     |                     | from raw admin data  |              |
          |-------------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------|

          |-------------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------|
 

As you gain an understanding of each code script, you will likely find more inputs and outputs -- we encourage you to update the [standardized spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LUIdVFH0OfR70C7z07TYeE-uWzKI_JIeWUMaYhqEKK0/edit#gid=1617799822&range=A1). Once finished with the reproduction exercise, classify each code file as *analysis* or *cleaning*. This subjective assessment should be made based on your interpretation of each script's main role.   


## Connect each output to all its inputs {#diagram}

With all the information collected above, you can trace your output to reproduce to its primary sources. Email the standardized spreadsheets from above (sections \@ref(desc-sourc), \@ref(desc-analy) and \@ref(desc-scripts)) to acre@berkeley.edu. With-in 24hrs you should receive an email with a reproduction tree that represents the information available on the workflow for behind a specific output. 

<!--
Upload the standardized table you build to the describe the code above into the [ACRE workflow diagram builder](ADD LINK). 
-->
### Complete workflow information 

If you were able to identify all the relevant components in the previous section, the ACRE builder will produce and diagram like the following.  

    table1.tex
        |___[code] analysis.R
            |___analysis_data.dta
                |___[code] final_merge.do
                    |___cleaned_1_2.dta
                    |   |___[code] clean_merged_1_2.do
                    |       |___merged_1_2.dta
                    |           |___[code] merge_1_2.do
                    |               |___cleaned_1.dta
                    |               |   |___[code] clean_raw_1.py
                    |               |       |___raw_1.dta
                    |               |___cleaned_2.dta
                    |                   |___[code] clean_raw_2.py
                    |                       |___raw_2.dta
                    |___cleaned_3_4.dta
                        |___[code] clean_merged_3_4.do
                            |___merged_3_4.dta
                                |___[code] merge_3_4.do
                                    |___cleaned_3.dta
                                    |   |___[code] clean_raw_3.py
                                    |       |___raw_3.dta
                                    |___cleaned_4.dta
                                        |___[code] clean_raw_4.py
                                            |___raw_4.dta

This diagram, built with the information provided by you (the reproducer), is already an important contribution to understanding all the necessary components required to reproduce a specific output. It conveys key information in a summarized fashion allowing for a more constructive exchange with original authors or other reproducers. For example, when contacting the original authors a request of the type "...file `cleaned_4.dta` in the diagram below (paste diagram) seems to be missing in the reproduction package. Could you please provide access to it?" is a specific and actionable request. It also demonstrates that the reproducer spent significant time understanding the relevant components of the reproduction package. 

### Incomplete workflow information 

In many cases, some of the components of the workflow will not be easily identifiable (or missing) in the reproduction package. Here the ACRE builder will return partial reproduction tree. For example, and using the diagram from above, if the reproduction materials had missing the files `merge_1_2.do, merge_3_4.do, final_merge.do`, the diagrams produced by the builder will be the following: 

    cleaned_3.dta
        |___[code] clean_raw_3.py
            |___raw_3.dta
    
    table1.tex
        |___[code] analysis.R
            |___analysis_data.dta
    
    cleaned_3_4.dta
        |___[code] clean_merged_3_4.do
            |___merged_3_4.dta
    
    cleaned_1.dta
        |___[code] clean_raw_1.py
            |___raw_1.dta
    
    cleaned_2.dta
        |___[code] clean_raw_2.py
            |___raw_2.dta
    
    cleaned_4.dta
        |___[code] clean_raw_4.py
            |___raw_4.dta
    
    cleaned_1_2.dta
        |___[code] clean_merged_1_2.do
            |___merged_1_2.dta
    Unusued data sources: None.

In this case, the reproducer can still combine this partial information with her knowledge from the paper and produce a candidate tree. One result could be the following: 

    
    table1.tex
        |___[code] analysis.R
            |___analysis_data.dta
                |___MISSSING CODE FILE(S) #3
                    |___cleaned_3_4.dta
                    |       |___[code] clean_merged_3_4.do
                    |           |___merged_3_4.dta
                    |               |___MISSSING CODE FILE(S) #2
                    |                   |___cleaned_3.dta
                    |                   |       |___[code] clean_raw_3.py
                    |                   |           |___raw_3.dta    
                    |                   |___cleaned_4.dta
                    |                           |___[code] clean_raw_4.py
                    |                               |___raw_4.dta
                    |___cleaned_1_2.dta

                                |___merged_1_2.dta
                                    |___MISSSING CODE FILE(S) #1

                                        |           |___raw_1.dta
                                        |   
                                        |___cleaned_2.dta
                                                |___[code] clean_raw_2.py

To leave a record of the reconstructed diagrams, you will have to amend the input spreadsheets using placeholders for the missing components. In the example above, you should go to the code description spreadsheet and add the following entries: 

          |-------------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------|
          | file_name         | location         | inputs              | outputs             | description          | primary_type |

          |-------------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------|

As in the case with the complete workflow, this diagrams (the fragmented trees, or the reconstructed one) provide important information to assess and improve the reproducibility of a specific output. Reproducers can compare reconstructed trees, and/or contact original authors with highly specific inquiries.

For more examples of diagrams connecting final output to initial raw data, [see here](#additional-diagrams).    

## Assign a reproducibility score. {#score}

Once you have identified all possible inputs and have a clear understanding of the connection between the outputs and inputs, you can start to assess the output-specific level of reproducibility. 

Take note of the following concepts in this section:     

 - **Computationally Reproducible from Analytic data (CRA):** The output can be reproduced with minimal effort starting from the *analytic* datasets.

 - **Computationally Reproducible from Raw data (CRR):** The output can be reproduced with minimal effort from the *raw* datasets.

 - **Minimal effort:** One hour or less are required to run the code, not including computing time.

### Levels of Computational Reproducibility for a Specific Output  

Each level of computational reproducibility is defined by the availability of data and materials, and whether or not the available materials faithfully reproduce the output of interest. The description of each level also includes possible improvements that can help advance the reproducibility of the output to a higher level. You will learn in more detail about the possible improvements. 

Note that the assessment is made *at the output level* -- a paper can be highly reproducible for its main results, but suffer from low reproducibility for other outputs. The assessment includes a 10-point scale, where 0 represents that, under current circumstances, reproducers cannot access any reproduction package, while 10 represents access to all the materials and being able to reproduce the target outcome from the raw data.

 - **Level 1 (L1):** No data or code are available. Possible improvements include adding: raw data (+AD), analysis data (+RD), cleaning code (+CC), and analysis code (+AC).
 
 You will have detected papers that are reproducible at Level 1 as part of the Scoping stage (unsuccessful candidate papers). Make sure to take record them in Survey 1.
 
 - **Level 2 (L2):** Code scripts are available (partial or complete), but no data are available. Possible improvements include adding: raw data (+AD) and analysis data (+RD). 

 - **Level 3 (L3):** Analytic data and code are partially available, but raw data and cleaning code are not. Possible improvements include: completing analysis data and/or code, adding raw data (+RD), and adding analysis code (+AC).  

 - **Level 4 (L4):** All analytic data sets and analysis code are available. However, code does not run or produces different results than those in the paper (not CRA). Possible improvements include debugging the analysis code (DAC) or obtaining raw data (+RD).      

 - **Level 5 (L5):** Analytic data sets and analysis code are available. They produce the same results as presented in the paper (CRA). The reproducibility package may be improved by obtaining the original raw data sets.
 
This is the highest level that most published research papers can attain currently. Computational reproducibility *from raw data* is required for papers that are reproducible at Level 6 and above.

 - **Level 6 (L6):** Cleaning code is partially available, but raw data is not. Possible improvements include: completing cleaning code (+CC) and/or raw data (+RD).   

 - **Level 7 (L7):** Cleaning code is available and complete, but raw data is not. Possible improvements include: adding raw data (+RD).  

 - **Level 8 (L8):** Cleaning code is available and complete, and raw data is partially available. Possible improvements include: adding raw data (+RD).

 - **Level 9 (L9):**  All the materials (raw data, analytic data, cleaning code, and analysis code) are available. The analysis code produces the same output as presented in the paper (CRA). However, the cleaning code does not run or produces different results that those presented in the paper (not CRR). Possible improvements include: debugging the cleaning code (DCC).  

 - **Level 10 (L10):** All the materials are available and produce the same results as presented in the paper with minimal effort, starting from the analytic data (yes CRA) or the raw data (yes CRR).  Note that Level 10 is aspirational and may be very difficult to attain for most research published today. 

The following figure summarizes the different levels of computational reproducibility (for any given output). For each level, there will be improvements that have been made (`✔`) or can be made to move up one level of reproducibility (-).

### Reproducibility dimensions at the paper level   

In addition to the output-specific assessment and improvement of computational reproducibility, several practices can facilitate reproducibility at the level of the overall paper. You can read about such practices in greater detail in the next chapter, dedicated to Stage 3: *Improvements*. In this  Assessment section, you should only verify whether the original reproduction package made use of any of the following: 

- master script that runs all steps
- readme file
- standardized file organization       
- version control 
- open source (statistical) software  
- dynamic document        
- computing capsule (e.g. CodeOcean, Binder, etc.)     

Congratulations! You have now completed the *Assessment* stage of this exercise. You have provided a concrete building block of knowledge to improve understanding of the state of reproducibility in Economics. 

Please continue to the [next section](#improvements) where you can help to improve it!
