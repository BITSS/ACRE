# Guidance for Requesting Reproduction Materials

The purpose of this chapter is to facilitate constructive and respectful communication between reproducers and the original authors. Exchanges that contain charged or/and adversarial language can damage professional relationships and hamper scientific progress. Janz and Freese ([2019](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/openscience/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Janz-Freese_-Good-and-Bad-Replications-1.pdf)) articulate two important steps that reproducers can take to ensure that their interactions with original authors are constructive. We provide a summary below and encourage you to follow this guidance. Remember the golden rule of reproductions (and replications): treat others and their work, as you would like others to treat you and your work!


   **1. Carefully and transparently plan your study. **  
   
   a. Clearly state that you are conducting a reproduction of the original work.   
   b. Explain why you have chosen this study. Try to proactively address potential concerns for selection   bias.  
   c. Explain how “far” your results must deviate from the original work before claiming that the study could not be reproduced. Engage deeply with the substantive literature to ensure that your interpretation of differences between the original and reproduction is thorough and acceptable to other authors in the field.  


   **2. Use professional and sensitive language. Discuss potential discrepancies between your work and the original paper just like you would have done for your own work.**  
   
   a. Avoid binary judgments such as “failed to reproduce,” and clearly state which results reproduced, and which did not (e.g. “we successfully reproduced X, but failed to reproduce Y”), unless you uncover a case of apparent scientific misconduct (e.g. see [Broockman, Kalla and Aronow, 2015](https://osf.io/qy2se/)).  
   b. Talk about *the study, not the author*, to avoid making it personal. Make clear what the positive contribution of the original article is. Consider sending a copy of your reproduction report to the original authors.  
   c. Discuss what the literature learns from your reproduction, and refrain from claiming to give the final answer to the question.   
   d. For papers published five or more years ago, be mindful that norms for reproducibility have evolved since then.   
   e. Remember, *the goal is not to criticize previous work or hunt for errors, but to move the literature forward!*  
   
To help put these recommendations into practice, we provide template language for common scenarios that reproducers and authors may encounter in their interactions.
   
   
**For reproducers:**  

   A. Contacting the original author(s) to request items that are missing;  
   B. Asking for additional guidance when some materials have been shared;  
   C. Response when the original author has refused to share an item due to undisclosed reasons;  
   D. Response when the original author has refused to share data due to legal or ethical constraints;  
   E. Contacting the original author to share the results of your reproduction exercise;  
   F. Responding to adversarial responses from original authors.  
  
**For authors:**  

   G. Responding to a request [TODO]  
   H. Acknowledging that some information is missing [TODO]  
   I. Acknowledging that some material is still embargoed for future research  [TODO]  
   J. Responding to incomplete/aggressive requests from reproducers  [TODO]  


We hope that you will find these useful. At the same time, note that they are *only recommendations*, and you are welcome to modify them based on the context and the needs of your project. Feel free to contact us if you need more guidance or would like to provide feedback on these materials.  


## For Reproducers Contacting the Authors of the Original Study



#### Verify in the ACRE database, if authors have been contacted before

#### Email them     

##### Template language   
[draft here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xJ7pZTQ1VQXVCrs6IUlp7HlBB4oxYha0oOniCG2SWLM/edit?ts=5d251563)

Remember to link template language to documentation for later, to check with team  

###### Requesting raw/analytic data and code  
###### Following up on a non-response requesting additional contact information
  - point out the level of reproducibility of project and how to improve 
  
###### Reporting improvements done to current reproducibility package

###### Requestion permission to re-post public data in new reproduction packages  
Would like to repost your data  
You already gave permission to authors XYZ  
Just trying to improve this authors reproducibility  
Your permission would allow students and researchers do more work in this area.  


###### If response  

Follow up with request of steps necessary for any researcher in the future to access this data.  



 - **Coding errors:**  a coding error will occur when a section in the code, of the reproduction package, executes a procedure that is in direct contradiction with the intended procedure expressed in the documentation (paper or comments of the code). For example an error happens if the paper specify that the analysis is perform on the population of males, but the code restricts the analysis to females only. Please follow the [ACRE procedure to report coding errors](ADD LINK).
