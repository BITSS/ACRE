<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 7</span> Guidance for a Constructive Exchange Between Reproducers and Original Authors</h1>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to facilitate constructive and respectful communication between reproducers (you) and original authors. Exchanges that contain charged or adversarial language can damage professional relationships and hamper scientific progress. Janz and Freese (<a href="https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/openscience/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Janz-Freese_-Good-and-Bad-Replications-1.pdf">2019</a>) articulate two important steps reproducers can take to ensure their interactions with original authors are constructive. We provide a summary below and encourage you to follow this guidance. Remember the golden rule of reproductions (and replications): <em>treat others and their work, as you would like others to treat you and your work!</em></p>
<p><strong>1. Carefully and transparently plan your study.</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Clearly state that you are conducting a reproduction of the original work.
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Explain why you have chosen this study. Try to proactively address potential concerns for selection bias.<br />
</li>
<li>Explain how “far” your results must deviate from the original work before claiming that the study could not be reproduced. Engage deeply with the substantive literature to ensure that your interpretation of differences between the original and reproduction is thorough and acceptable to other authors in the field.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2. Use professional and sensitive language. Discuss potential discrepancies between your work and the original paper just like you would have done for your own work.</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Avoid binary judgments and statements like “failed to reproduce.” Clearly state which results reproduced and which did not (e.g., “we successfully reproduced X, but failed to reproduce Y”) unless you uncover apparent scientific misconduct (e.g. see <a href="https://osf.io/qy2se/">Broockman, Kalla and Aronow, 2015</a>).<br />
</li>
<li>Talk about <em>the study, not the author</em>, to avoid making it personal. Make clear what the positive contribution of the original article is. Consider sending a copy of your reproduction report to the original authors.<br />
</li>
<li>Discuss what your reproduction contributes to the literature, and refrain from claiming to give the final answer to the question.<br />
</li>
<li>For papers published five or more years ago, be mindful that norms for reproducibility have evolved since then.<br />
</li>
<li>Remember, <em>the goal is not to criticize previous work or hunt for errors, but to move the literature forward!</em></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>To help put these recommendations into practice, we provide template language for common scenarios that reproducers and authors may encounter in their interactions.</p>
<p>While we hope that you find these useful, note that they are <em>only recommendations</em>, and you are welcome to modify them based on the context and needs of your specific project. Feel free to contact us if you need more guidance or would like to provide feedback on these materials.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.1.1</span> Before you contact the original author</h3>
<p>Considering the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Carefully read all footnotes, appendices, tables, captions, etc. to learn if, how, and where reproduction materials are provided. Follow this <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Verification_guidance.html">Data and Code Guidance</a> to determine whether you have everything before you start. A few things to consider:
<ul>
<li>A Readme file, if available, would be a good place to start. All papers published in AEA journals after July 2019 should have a Readme file.<br />
</li>
<li>Check whether there are any restrictions to accessing the data or code, and whether there are instructions on how to access these files for the purpose of reproduction.</li>

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Reproduction materials for <code>[“Title of the paper”]</code></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Dr. <code>[Lastname of Corresponding Author]</code>,</p>
<p>I am contacting you about reproduction materials for your paper titled <code>[Title]</code> which was published in <code>[Journal]</code> in <code>[year]</code> (vol <code>[volume]</code>, no. <code>[no.]</code>), <code>[link]</code>.
I am a <code>[graduate student/postdoc/other position]</code> at <code>[Institution]</code>, and I’m working to reproduce this paper as part of a class exercise. <code>[Add context for why you want to reproduce this particular paper using neutral language (e.g., &quot;This is a seminal paper in my field&quot;), avoiding any statements that would put the respondent on the defensive]</code>.</p>
<p>To be able to reproduce the paper in full, I hope that you can share the following items: [<code>list items missing from reproduction package, preferably bulleted if more than one (raw/analytic data, code, protocols for conducting the experiment, etc.)</code>]. I have already searched <code>[locations where you searched for items, with links provided]</code>, however I was not able to locate the items there. You can be assured that I will not share any of the materials without your permission, and I will use them exclusively for the purpose of this exercise. Let me know if there are any legal or ethical restrictions that apply to all or parts of the reproduction materials so that I can take that into consideration during this exercise.</p>
<p>Note that I will record the outcome of my reproduction on the Advancing Computational Reproducibility in Economics (ACRE) platform [ADD LINK], an online catalog of reproduction projects in economics. ACRE is hosted by the <a href="https://www.bitss.org/">Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (BITSS)</a>. Let me know if you would like me to share the outcome of my exercise with you and whether you are interested in providing a response.</p>
<p>Since I am required to complete this project by <code>[date]</code>, I would appreciate your response by <code>[deadline]</code>.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any questions. Please also feel free to contact my supervisor/instructor <code>[Name (email)]</code> for further details on this exercise. Thank you in advance for your help!</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />

<p>Thank you for sharing the materials. They have been immensely helpful for my work.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I ran into a few issues as I delved into the reproduction exercise, and I think your guidance would be helpful in resolving them. <code>[Describe the issues and how you have tried to resolve them.

<p>Dear Dr. <code>[Lastname of Corresponding Author]</code>,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response, and for clarifying the terms of use of the reproduction materials.</p>
<p>Though I understand that you are unable to share the raw data, there may be alternative steps you can take that would help me improve the reproducibility of your paper. These include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Sharing the analytic version of the data (the version of the dataset that was used in the final version of your paper);<br />
</li>
<li>Providing a public description of the steps other researchers can follow to request access to the raw data or materials, including an estimate of the costs and the duration of the process (find an example/checklist here[ADD EXAMPLE]); and<br />
</li>
<li>Providing access to all data and materials for which the constraints do not apply.</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on my assessment, your paper would currently rank at <code>[level X]</code> on the ACRE reproducibility scale [ADD LINK], however <em>this score can be easily improved</em>. Being able to provide analytic data would elevate the reproducibility of your paper to <code>[level Y]</code>. Providing public instructions on how other parties can access the data would further elevate its reproducibility to <code>[level Z]</code>.</p>
<p>I would be happy to help if you are interested in taking any of the steps I outlined above. Let me know if that would be helpful.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<div id="harassment-andor-discrimination" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">7.1.7.2</span> Harassment and/or discrimination</h4>
<p>The AEA and other economic societies have strict policies against harassment and discrimination. Here are some of the behaviors that the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/aea-policy-harassment-discrimination">AEA Policy on Harassment and Discrimination</a> has listed as unacceptable, and could emerge in a hostile exchange regarding a reproduction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intentionally intimidating, threatening, harassing, or abusive actions or remarks (both spoken and in other media)
<ul>
<li>Prejudicial actions or comments that undermine the principles of equal opportunity, fair treatment, or free academic exchange</li>
<li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
<li>Real or implied threat of physical harm.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a some steps you can take if you believe you have bullying, discrimination or harassment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File a complaint with the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/aea-ombudsperson">AEA Ombudsperson</a>.</strong> Any AEA member can file a complaint (you can also join the AEA solely for the purpose of filing a report). The person about whome you are making the complaint need not be an AEA member. A non-AEA member can also file a report if the act of harassment or discrimination was committed by an AEA member or in the context of an AEA-sponsored activity. Learn more about the process <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/aea-ombudsperson/faq">here</a>.
<ul>
<li><strong>File a report with your institution’s office for the prevention of harassment &amp; discrimination.</strong> US-based institutions have internal mechanisms that allow students and faculty to seek support in cases of discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, color, national origin, gender, age, or sexual orientation/identity, including allegations of sexual harassment and sexual violence. Formal titles of this office vary across institutions, but common names include “Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination” (in institutions that are part of the University of California) system, “Office of Equity and Title IX”, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Contact your institution’s Ombudsperson/Ombuds Office.</strong> If you believe that you have experienced academic bullying or other forms of disrespectful behavior that fall outside the scope of harassment and/or discrimination as described above, you should know that university ombuds officers are a confidential, impartial resource to discuss your concerns and learn about potential next steps available in your case.</li>
<li><strong>Access mental health services at your institution.</strong> Many universities offer short-term Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (CAPS) for academic, career, and personal issues.</li>
<li><strong>Ask for support from your academic supervisor.</strong> If you are unsure on how to proceed, consult your academic supervisor on whether continuing the exercise would be appropriate.</li>
