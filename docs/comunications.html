<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 8</span> Guidance for Constructive Communication Between Reproducers and Original Authors</h1>
<p>This chapter contains guidance for constructive and respectful communication between reproducers and original authors. Exchanges that contain charged or adversarial language can damage professional relationships and hamper scientific progress. Janz and Freese (<a href="https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/openscience/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Janz-Freese_-Good-and-Bad-Replications-1.pdf">2019</a>) articulate two important steps reproducers can take to ensure that their interactions with original authors are constructive. We summarize and build on this approach below and encourage you to follow this guidance. Remember the <strong>golden rule of reproductions</strong> (and replications): <em>treat others and their work, as you would like others to treat you and your work!</em></p>
<p><strong>1. Carefully and transparently plan your study.</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Clearly state that you are conducting a reproduction of their original work.<br />
</li>
<li>Explain why you have chosen this study.</li>
<li>If you are not able to reproduce the results explain how “far” your results must deviate from the original work before claiming that the study could not be reproduced. Engage deeply with the substantive literature to ensure that your interpretation of differences between the original and reproduction is thorough and acceptable to other authors in the field.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2. Use professional and sensitive language. Discuss potential discrepancies between your work and the original paper, just like you might do for your own work.</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Avoid binary judgments and statements like “failed to reproduce.” Instead, state clearly which results reproduced and which did not (e.g., “we successfully reproduced X, but failed to reproduce Y”) unless you uncover apparent scientific misconduct (e.g., see <a href="https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/qy2se">Broockman, Kalla and Aronow, 2015</a>).<br />
</li>
<li>Talk about <em>the study, not the author</em> to avoid making it personal. Make clear what the positive contribution of the original article is. Consider sending a copy of your reproduction report to the original authors.<br />
</li>
<li>Discuss what your reproduction contributes to the literature, and refrain from claiming to give the final answer to the question.<br />
</li>
<li>For papers published five or more years ago, be mindful that norms for reproducibility have evolved since then.<br />
</li>
<li>Remember, <em>the goal is not to criticize previous work or hunt for errors, but to move the literature forward!</em></li>
</ol>
<p>To help you put these recommendations into practice, we developed template language for common scenarios that reproducers and authors may encounter in their interactions. While we hope you find these useful, note that they are <em>only recommendations</em>, and you are welcome to modify them based on your project’s context and needs. Feel free to <a href="mailto:acre@berkeley.edu">contact us</a> if you need more guidance or would like to provide feedback on these materials.</p>
<div id="for-reproducers-contacting-the-authors-of-the-original-study" class="section level2" number="8.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> For reproducers contacting the authors of the original study</h2>
<p>Consider the following <em>before</em> you contact the original authors:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Search the SSRP for reproduction materials or records of past interactions with the authors of a given paper. For each reproduction, consult the “Author inquiries” column to see whether authors have indicated whether they are available for further inquiries.</p></li>
<li><p>Carefully read all footnotes, appendices, tables, captions, etc., to learn if, how, and where reproduction materials are provided. Follow this <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Verification_guidance.html">Data and Code Guidance</a> to determine whether you have everything before you start. A few things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>Readme</em> file, if available, would be a good place to start.<br />
</li>
<li>Check whether there are any restrictions on accessing the data or code, and whether there are instructions on how to access these files for the purpose of reproduction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If a reproduction package is not readily available in the location where the article is published (e.g., the journal website), check the authors’ websites, Dataverse profiles, or other relevant archives and/or data repositories like the <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/">ICPSR Publications Related Archive</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>If steps 1 and 2 don’t yield anything, contact the corresponding author (copying the co-authors, if any), consolidating your requests into as few emails as possible. In your email, make sure to include the following details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic information about the paper to reproduce (include title, version, date, and a DOI (or just a URL));<br />
</li>
<li>Context for the reproduction (as part of a class exercise, thesis, personal project, etc.) and a note that the outcome will be recorded on the <a href="https://www.socialsciencereproduction.org/">Social Science Reproduction Platform</a>(SSRP);</li>
<li>Items from the reproduction package that are missing, as well as locations where you had (unsuccessfully) searched for them;<br />
</li>
<li>Your use plan: Will the materials be used exclusively for this project? Ask for permission to share the data publicly.<br />
</li>
<li>Right to consultation and results: Will you share the outcome of the reproduction with the original authors?<br />
</li>
<li>A deadline to respond (we suggest at least two weeks).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Follow up if you don’t get a response within two weeks (or whatever deadline you set), and include any details or clarifications that were left out in your first email.</p></li>
<li><p>Record the outcome of your interaction with the original author at the <em>Select a Paper</em> stage on the SSRP. You can qualify the outcome as one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>complete</em> reproduction package was provided;</li>
<li>An <em>incomplete</em> reproduction package was provided. You can also select one of the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>Data is of sensitive, confidential, or proprietary character and cannot be shared;</li>
<li>Data is of sensitive, confidential, or proprietary character, but access instructions were provided.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The author <em>declined</em> to share the reproduction package; or</li>
<li>The author <em>did not respond</em> (including after a reminder was sent) within four weeks after the initial request.</li>
</ul></li>

<p>Thank you for your response and for clarifying the terms of use for the reproduction materials.</p>
<p>Though I understand you are unable to share the raw data, there may be alternative steps you can take that would help me improve the reproducibility of your paper. These include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Sharing the analytic version of the data (the version of the dataset that was used for analysis in the final version of your paper);<br />
</li>
<li>Providing a public description of the steps other researchers can follow to request access to the raw data or materials, including an estimate of the costs and the duration of the process. You can find examples of data availability statements for proprietary or restricted-access data <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Requested_information_dcas.html">here</a>; and<br />
</li>
<li>Providing access to all data and materials for which the constraints do not apply.</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on my assessment, your paper would currently rank at <code>[level X]</code> on the <a href="https://bitss.github.io/ACRE/assessment.html#levels-of-computational-reproducibility-for-a-specific-output">SSRP reproducibility scale</a>. However, <em>this score can be easily improved</em>. Being able to provide analytic data would elevate the reproducibility of your paper to <code>[level Y]</code>. Providing public instructions on how other parties can access the data would further elevate its reproducibility to <code>[level Z]</code>.</p>

Though every interaction between authors and reproducers takes place is distinct and may carry its unique challenges, the guiding principle of <a href="https://bitss.github.io/ACRE/guidance-for-a-constructive-exchange-between-reproducers-and-original-authors.html">this chapter</a> always applies: “Treat others and their work as you would like others to treat you and your work!” We hope that these resources will facilitate more efficient and constructive exchanges between the parties involved. <a href="emailto:acre@berkeley.edu">Let us know</a> if you need guidance in other scenarios!</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.2.1</span> Responding to a repeated request that has been addressed in an earlier interaction</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear [Reproducer],</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in my work. I have been contacted about this issue by another SSRP reproducer before and provided a response, which I suspect may be already recorded on the SSRP. I’m copying my original response below for your reference. You may find further guidance in the readme file in the reproduction package.</p>
<p>If there are no prior records of these issues on the SSRP, please record the enclosed response [and materials]. This will also help avoid the duplication of effort on the part of others who may be interested in reproducing this work.</p>
<p>Good luck with the remainder of your project and thank you in advance for your cooperation!</p>
<p>Best regards,

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.2.2</span> Acknowledging that the author no longer has access to certain part(s) of the reproduction package</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear [Reproducer],</p>
<p>Thank you for reviewing my work closely. I wish I could be of more help, but unfortunately I no longer have access to the requested materials due to <code>[briefly describe the circumstances that prevent you from providing the materials]</code>.</p>
<p>While I recognize that the current standards in the discipline have moved towards computational reproducibility, note that this paper was written when different standards applied. Please feel free to evaluate the paper as is and propose any improvements wherever possible.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with you to address this and improve the overall reproducibility of the paper.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.2.3</span> Acknowledging that some material is still embargoed for future research</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear [Reproducer],</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in my work. The data/materials/program that you reference are currently not publicly available because they are embargoed until <code>[embargo period]</code>.</p>
<p><code>[Depending on the restrictions that apply to the reproduction package, consider alternatives to sharing the reproduction materials in full. These include: 1.Sharing the analytic version of the data (the version of the dataset that was used for analysis in the final version of your paper);  2. Providing a public description of the steps that other researchers can follow to request access to the raw data or materials, including an estimate of the costs and the duration of the process. Find examples of data availability statements for proprietary or restricted-access data [here](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Requested_information_dcas.html); and 3. Providing access to all data and materials for which the constraints do not apply.]</code></p>

<p>Dear [Reproducer],</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in my work. I would be happy to assist you and other reproducers to assess and improve the reproducibility of this paper.</p>
<p>To help me give more concrete guidance, I’d appreciate if you could provide a more specific description &gt;of the items that you need from me. You can find helpful information and resources in Chapter 6 of the Guide, &gt;specifically <a href="https://bitss.github.io/ACRE/guidance-for-a-constructive-exchange-between-reproducers-and-original-authors.html#asking-for-additional-guidance-when-some-materials-have-been-shared">here</a> <code>[based on the context, you may need to point &gt;the reproducer to a &gt;different scenario and/or provide further information]</code>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.3</span> Harassment and/or discrimination</h2>
<p>The American Economic Association (AEA) and other academic societies have strict policies against harassment and discrimination. Here are some of the behaviors that the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/aea-policy-harassment-discrimination">AEA Policy on Harassment and Discrimination</a> has listed as unacceptable and could emerge in a hostile exchange regarding a reproduction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intentionally intimidating, threatening, harassing, or abusive actions or remarks (both spoken and in other media)
<ul>
<li>Prejudicial actions or comments that undermine the principles of equal opportunity, fair treatment, or free academic exchange</li>
<li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
<li>Real or implied threat of physical harm.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a some steps you can take if you believe you have experienced bullying, discrimination or harassment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File a complaint with the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/aea-ombudsperson">AEA Ombudsperson</a>.</strong> Any AEA member can file a complaint. You can also join the AEA solely to file a report. The person about whom you are making the complaint need not be an AEA member. A non-AEA member can also file a report if the act of harassment or discrimination was committed by an AEA member or in the context of an AEA-sponsored activity. Learn more about the process <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/aea-ombudsperson/faq">here</a>.
<ul>
<li><strong>File a report with your institution’s office for the prevention of harassment &amp; discrimination.</strong> US-based institutions have internal mechanisms that allow students and faculty to seek support in cases of discrimination and harassment based on race, color, national origin, gender, age, or sexual orientation/identity, including allegations of sexual harassment and sexual violence. Formal titles of this office vary across institutions, but common names include “Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination” (in institutions that are part of the University of California system), “Office of Equity and Title IX,” etc.</li>
<li><strong>Contact your institution’s Ombudsperson/Ombuds Office.</strong> If you believe that you have experienced academic bullying or other forms of disrespectful behavior that fall outside the scope of harassment and/or discrimination as described above, you should know that university ombuds officers offer a confidential, impartial resource to discuss your concerns and learn about potential next steps available in your case.</li>
<li><strong>Access mental health services at your institution.</strong> While no amount of bullying, discrimination, or harassment is acceptable or the fault of the victim, these unfortunately still occur and can take a toll on victims’ mental health. Many universities offer short-term Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (CAPS) for academic, career, and personal issues.</li>
<li><strong>Ask for support from your academic supervisor.</strong> If you are unsure on how to proceed, consult your academic supervisor on whether continuing the reproduction is appropriate.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
