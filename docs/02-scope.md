# Scoping

In the Scoping stage, you will choose a paper to reproduce, or be assigned one, verify that the paper has some reproduction materials, and if materials are available you will read the paper and declare the scope of the reprodcution excercise. Chapter 1 describes the steps for defining the scope of a reproduction exercise. ***Use [Survey 1](https://berkeley.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3UWe5xu3qjeh0c5) to record your work for this stage.***

## Basic concepts.  


## Before you begin.

### Identify your relevant timeline.  

Be mindful of your time limitations when defining the scope of your reproduction activity. This will be given by the type of excercise chosen by the instructor/academic advisor. These will vary from the format of a homeworrk over a couple of weeks, to a longer project that accounts a for a larger fraction of a class (or independent study) that may take a month to complete, or to a semester long project (most likely in the undergraduate thesis format).

Table 1 shows tentative distribution of time across three different reproduction formats. The scoping aand assessment stages are expected to last raoughly the same across all formats (with some additional day for the semester long format, forseeing less experience with research if the reprducer is an undergraduate). Difference emerge when distribution the time for the last two main stages: Improvements and Robustness. For excercises of short duraction, we recommend to stay away from any possible improvements to the raw data (or cleaning code), this will inturn limit the amount of robustness check (for example by not being able to reconstruct variable according to slightly different definitions), but it should leave plenty of space for testing different specifications at the analysis level.

### Select a candidate paper, or be assing one. 

Ideally you, should select your candidte paper without previously exploring the availability of materials. In the following sections (X - Y) this guidelines will show you how to inspect the feasibility of starting a reproduction excercise in your candiate paper. If there is not enought materials to pursue a reproduction, you will be asked to create a short entry in the ACRE platform (<15 minutes) and select a new candidate paper. 

Repeat this step until you have found a paper with a reproduction package, this will be your declared paper. Do not invest time on doing a detail read of any paper until you are sure to have declared paper.

### Check records on the ACRE platform. {#check-acre}

Check the [ACRE database](ADD LINK) for previous assessments of the your candidate paper. If there are previous entries, you will see a brief report card with the following information: 

> **Title:**  Sample Title   
> **Authors:**  Jane Doe & John Doe  
> **Original Reproduction Package Avaiable:** URL/No  
> [If "No"] **Contacted Authors?:** Yes/No  
> [If "Yes(contacted)"] **Type of Response:** Categories (6).  
> **Additional Reproduction Packages:** Number (eg., 2)   
> **Authors Available for Further Questions for ACRE Reproductions:** Yes/No/Unknown   
> **Open for reproductions:** Yes/No  

### Verify that reproduction package exist.  {#verify-rep-mat}

 - **Reproduction package:** Collection of all the materials associated with the reproduction of a paper. A reproduction package may contain  data, code and documentation. When the materials are provided in the original publication they will be labeled as 'original reproduction package', when they provided by a previous reproducer they will be refered as 'reproducer X's reproduction package'. At this point you are only assessing the existence of one (or more) reproduction packages, you are will not be assessing the quality of its content at this stage. 


Verify that the paper has reproduction package. If there is no reproduction package, use our records to check if requests to authors a reproduction package have been made before. If nobody has not yet submitted a similar request, you are encourage to contact the authors using language suggested [here](#for-reproducers-contacting-the-authors-of-the-original-study), making sure to copy (acre@berkeley.edu). 

If the authors provide any materials, create a public project in the [Open Science Framework/ICPSRopen/Dataverse] and deposit all these materials under the name `Original reproduction materials for - Title of the paper`. Provide the URL for the repository in the ACRE records.   

If the authors have been contacted before, and provided no response, you are encourage to follow up with a reminder email using the same language. Do not forget to to copy (acre@berkeley.edu). 

If the authors have provided a response but the reproduction package is still missing, you should verify category assigned to the original response. If the author indicated that they cannot provide any additional information you are discourage from contacting them again. Create an record in the ACRE database. 

<!--  
### Advise on scoping for different course length

2-week courses should not try to improve reproducibility from raw data
-->


If you verified the existence of a reproduction package, your candidate paper is now your declared paper for the ACRE excercise. You can now read the paper! 

If you verified the a reproduction package does not exist, please leave the proper record in our ACRE database and select a new candidate paper. 


## Read and summarize the paper. {#read-sum}

Depending on how much time you have, we recommend that you write a short summary of the paper. This will help remind you of the key elements to focus on for the reproduction, and to demonstrate your understanding of the paper (for yourself and potentially for the original author).

When reading/summarizing the paper, you should try to answer the following main questions:  

 - Would you classify the paper's scientific claims as mainly focused on estimating a causal relationship, estimating/predicting a descriptive statistic of a population, or something else? 
 - How many scientific claims (descriptive or causal) are investigated in the paper? 
 - How many outputs are in the paper (tables, figures and inline results)?  
 - What is the main statistical or econometric method used to examine each claim?
 - What is the population for which the estimates apply?
 - What is the main population that is the focus of the paper as a whole?
 - What are the main data sources used in the paper?

Definitions: 

**Causal claim:** This paper estimates the effect of X on Y for population P, using method F. Example: "This paper investigates the impact of bicycle provision on secondary school enrollment among young women in Bihar/India, using a Difference in Difference approach." 

**Descriptive/predictive claim:** This paper estimates the value of Y (estimated or predicted) for population P under dimensions X using method M. Example: "Drawing on a unique Swiss data set (population P) and exploiting systematic anomalies in countries’ portfolio investment positions (method M), I find that around 8% of the global financial wealth of households is held in tax havens (value of Y) "

## Declare scope of the exercise.

- Declare the output to reproduce

- Declare 
By now you should have selected a paper that contains a reproduction package, and have a fairly good understanding of the content of the paper. Before you begin working on the three main stages of the reproduction excercise (assessment, improvement, and robustness) 
Declare if your assessment will be of all of the paper’s results (**complete**) or the **main results**, and if you will aim to start with **raw data** or **processed data**. Find definitions of these concepts below. 

ADD description that scoping involves chosing paper, output and level of depth to improve. Given output assessment is all the way to raw data. But improvement and robustness should be limited to the amount of time is provided for the excercise.
  

### Define your reproduction margins.

#### Define the *extensive margin*: outputs to reproduced {#outputs}  

Define whether you will attempt to reproduce all of your chosen paper’s results or just the main results.    

- **Complete**: A successful complete reproduction obtains all of the same estimates presented in the chosen paper. This includes tables, figures, and inline estimates, both in the main body of the paper and the appendices.  
  
- **Main results**: A successful reproduction of main results obtains the same estimates as those highlighted in the chosen paper’s abstract, introduction, or conclusion. If no estimate is highlighted, you should choose the main result and declare it at the beggining of the reproduction.  

##### Describe the types of output.   

Broadly describe the outputs you will attempt to reproduce.

  - **Tables:** Describe how to cite record location. 
  - **Figures:**  ADD   
  - **In-line:**  ADD    


#### Define the *intensive margin*: depth of reproduction in terms of original data. {#intensive}

 - **Raw data** sets are unmodified files obtained by the authors from the sources cited in the paper. Raw data from which personally identifiable information (PII) has been removed is still considered raw. All other modifications to raw data make it *processed*.  
 - **Processed data** are raw data sets that have gone through any transformation other than the removal of PII. There are two kinds of processed data:  
      - *Intermediate data* are not directly used as final input for analyses presented in the final paper (including appendices). Intermediate data should not contain direct identifiers.  
      - *Analytic data* is used as the final input in a workflow in order to produce a statistic displayed in the paper (including appendices).  

##### Classifying a data set
A data set may be classified as **raw** if it fits any of the following criteria:    

 - The data is stored in a folder or file labeled as “raw”.  
 - The data set is not the output of any code script in the reproduction package.    
 - The same data file can be independently obtained from the data source cited in the paper.  

A data set may be classified as **analytic** if it fits any of the following criteria:   

 - The data is stored in a folder or file labeled as “analytic” or “analysis.”
 - The data set is the last input required to produce some of the output (formatted or unformatted) of the paper.
  


## Sample strategies for scoping  

ADD. 

### Strategy 1: 

1. Attempt to reproduce the paper’s main estimates.
2. Attempt to reproduce two main tables and/or two main figures.
3. Try to make improvements to these outputs. 
4. Try to reproduce the rest of the paper.
   

### Strategy 2:  

1. Attempt to reproduce all outputs resulting from the analytic data.
2. Once you can do that,  try to make improvements.
3. If you can make improvements, attempt to reproduce the outputs starting from raw data. (or in parallel?)
