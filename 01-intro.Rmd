# Introduction {#intro} 

Replication, or the process by which a study’s hypotheses and findings are re-examined using different data or different methods (or both) (King 1995) is an essential part of the scientific process that allows science to be “self-correcting.” Computational reproducibility, or the ability to reproduce the results, tables, and other figures using the available data, code, and materials, is a precondition for replication. Computational reproducibility is assessed through the process of reproduction. At the center of this process is the reproducer (you!), a party not involved in the production of the original paper. Reproductions sometimes involve the original author (whom we refer to as “the author”) in cases where additional guidance and materials are needed to execute the process.

This exercise is designed for reproductions performed in Economics graduate courses or undergraduate theses, with the goal of providing common terminology and standards for conducting reproductions. The goal of reproduction, in general, is to assess and improve the computational reproducibility of published research in a way that facilitates future replication, extension, and collaboration.

This exercise is part of the Advancing Computational Reproducibility in Economics (ACRE) project led by the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences [(BITSS)](bitss.org) and Prof. Lars Vilhuber, Data Editor for the journals of the American Economic Association (AEA). The ACRE project builds on efforts to improve the reproducibility of economics research through the updated [Data and Code Availability Policy](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-code/), which since 2019 mandates pre-publication verification of computational reproducibility by the AEA Data Editor. Several [specific recommendations](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/) were also produced to facilitate the authors' compliance.

## Beyond binary judgments

Assessments of reproducibility can easily gravitate towards binary assessments that declare a entire paper "reproducible" or "non-reproducible". These guidelines suggest a more nuance approach by highlighting three dimensions that make binary judgement less relevant. Firs one paper usually contains several scientific claims, and those claims can vary in computational reproducbility. Second, each claim is typically measured through several specifications. This makes easier for reproducers to hypothesize after the fact about which are the main specifications where reproducibility assessed. Finally, there are several levels of reproucibility, ranging from the absence of any materials to the complete reproducibility starting from the raw data. And even for a specific claim-specification, distinguishing the appropriate level can be far more constructive than simple labeling as (ir)reproducible.

```

I should be noticed that the highest level of reproducibility, which requires complete reproducibility starting from the raw data, is very demanding and it should not be expected of published research (especially that published before 2019). This high bar is set up as an aspiration to improve the current reproducibility of research and facilitate the transmission of knowledge in the scientific community. 


## Stages of the exercise

This reproduction exercise is divided into four stages, with a fifth optional stage :   

1.	**Scoping**, where the reproducer defines the scope of the exercise by declaring a paper and specific output(s) on which they will focus;  
2.	**Assessment**, where the reproducer reviews and describes in detail the available reproduction materials (or the “reproduction package”) and assess current levels of computational reproducibility;  
3.	**Improvement**, where the reproducer modifies the content and/or the organization of the reproduction materials to improve its reproducibility;  
4.	**Robustness checks**, where the reproducer assesses the quality of selected analytical choices from the paper; and  
5.	**Extension** (if applicable), where the reproducer may “extend” the current paper by including new methodologies or data. This step brings the reproduction exercise a step closer to replication.

Figure 1 depicts the suggested levels of effort for each stage of the exercise depending on the context in which you are performing this exercise. This process need not be chronologically linear, e.g. you can realize that the scope of their reproduction is too ambitious and then switch to a less intensive reproduction. Later in the exercise, you can also begin testing different specifications for robustness while also assessing the current level of reproducibility.

## Recording the results of the exercise

You will be asked to record the results of your reproduction as you make progress through different stages. After the [scoping stage](#scoping), you will be asked to complete [a survey](https://berkeley.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8hLHNI6LGSYchEN) that records paper of choice and specific outputs to reproduce. In the [assessment stage](#assessment), you should inspect all the reproduction materials (raw data, analysis data and code), draw diagrams that connect the target output (to reproduce) with all its inputs, and score the level of reproducibility. All this information will be recorded in a [standarized spreadsheet](ADD LINK). At the [improvement  stage]((#improvements)), you can record any specific improvements report any potential increase in the reported level of reproducibility in a second short survey. Finally, in the [robustness stage](#robust) you will record any analytical choice and possible variations of it.
