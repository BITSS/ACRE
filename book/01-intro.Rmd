# Introduction {#intro}

This guidelines are designed to standarized reproduction excercises perfomed in graduate courses or undergraduate thesis. 
The goal is to provide a unifed terminology and standards to assess and improve the computational reproducibility of published research. 
During this excercise, students are ask to report the result of their reproduction in a structure fashion. The work of student will be 
crowdsourced for two purposes. First, the assessments will be aggregated to compute reproducibility rates in economics. Second, the 
improvements to reproducibiliy created by students will be posted to the public, facilitating incremental improvements and critical 
assessment. 


## Stages of the exercises

The reproduction exercise is separated into five different stages: scoping, assessment, improvement, robustness and (possible) extensions. 
First students should define the scope of the exercise by declaring a paper and specific output to reproduce. Second, the reproduction materials 
are reviewed and describe in detail. Third, the student can improve the current reproduction materials. Fourth, robustness checks can be carried out
and recorded in a systematic fashion. Finally, students in a research stage, could extend the current paper to new methodologies or data.

      Suggested level of effort:
      - Graduate
        research:   5%       10%        5%         10%         70%
      - Graduate
        course:    10%       25%       20%         40%         5%
      - Undergrad.
        thesis:    10%       30%       40%         20%         0%

Figure 1 depicts the connection between the five stages of the reproduction exercise. 
The three main populations that are likely to work with this framework are: graduate students (and researchers) doing research, 
graduate students in a class, and undergraduate students in a thesis project. These three groups will
differ in the amount of time and focus that will place on each stage. Figure 1
suggest some possible time allocation for each category.  

## Recording the results of the exercise

For the scoping part:   

Complete survey one to record initial scoping. 

For the assessment part:  

 **Raw data**      
 
- Identify data sources  
- Connect data sources with data files  
- Inspect completeness of data files  

 **Analysis data**  
 
- List all the files  
- Identify the location  
- Provide brief description  


**Code**  

- list all the files  
- location  
- identify input files  
- identify output files  
- classify script into mainly analysis or mainly cleaning  

**Draw diagrams**

**Score output**

**Score paper**  

For the improvement part:  

Describe output level improvement, including new level, type of improvement, and brief description.  


For the robustness part: 

- Identify all possible analytical choices: original and repeated ones.   
- Identify type of choice.  
- Identify choice value. 
- Suggest choice alternative and justify (one line)  

   

## Non-linear process
Examples:  

- After scoping, student realices that reproduction requires much more work than originally expected, then switches to a less intensive reproduction.   

- While improving, student begins to play around with different definitions of variables or estimation methods, effectively jumping ahead to the robustness step.
